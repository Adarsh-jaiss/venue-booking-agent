These three were fantastic and made sure that we were taken care of throughout the night.... As far as the BPL itself, it is a dream wedding venue, and we were so lucky and thankful to make that dream a reality. The Courtyard is gorgeous in the evening light, and the Bates Room (green lamp room) is so unique. We danced in the Abbey Room, which was so neat and perfect for dancing. Each room has its own awesome personality - guarantee your guests will be enthralled.\""

        "description": "My husband and I had our wedding in the Courtyard at BPL! We did the Picnic Package that was made available to couples who had to cancel their original wedding plans due to COVID. And I am so happy this happened!! We got the last time slot on our original day and were able to have our parents, photographer, and videographer attend. Alyssa at The Catered Affair was our contact at the beginning for logistics and food and was super helpful! We had the Mezze lunchboxes and it was delicious. Ken was our day-of contact and was so amazing!! He allowed us to come in a few minutes early to capture the lighting on the Grand Staircase. Without him, we wouldn’t have captured such gorgeous pictures!! He was super responsive, sweet, and helpful. He was in charge of the music and his playlist was perfect. We’re so happy with the staff, venue, and everything in between. Thank you for turning our last minute wedding into one we couldn’t have ever dreamed of. Thank you!"

Working with Bryanne, our coordinator, and the entire Catered Affair team really made our wedding day so enjoyable – we didn’t have to stress about anything. Throughout the year-long planning process, Bryanne was incredibly responsive, informative, and professional; she helped us coordinate with each one of our vendors to create the perfect day. Day of, Bryanne orchestrated a completely seamless day from the photos prior to our ceremony through the very end of our reception. My favorite part of working with The Catered Affair was the breadth and depth of their knowledge around wedding planning and their high attention to detail – and the amazing food! I honestly cannot think of a more beautiful place to get married in Boston!"

        "description": "Thank you so much to you and your team for last night’s Winter Party! It was a wonderful event, and we’ve heard such positive things from leadership and attendees. The backdrop of Winthrop Center - and the service, food, and drinks - was a big part of the success. This may be the most praise we’ve received for a corporate party in a while. In year’s past, we’ve felt like we needed to micromanage things, and that wasn’t the case in working with you all. Even small things like having up-lights and votives in-house was helpful. I loved that the signs at the bar had even been animated with snow, and you somehow matched our logo font for some of the signs. People loved the tiny espresso martinis, the pizza, and passed apps. Hope to work with you again in the future!"

From start to finish, Jamison went above and beyond to meet our every need and exceed our expectations. The venue itself is stunning, but what truly sets Royale apart is their next-level AV and LED systems—they're unmatched! We also absolutely loved DJ Ryan, who was recommended by the venue. Our guests couldn't stop raving about the music and the overall vibe! Jamison and the entire Royale team were incredible—professional, attentive, and genuinely dedicated to making our event a success. We couldn't have asked for a better experience. If you're planning an event in Boston, I highly recommend Jamison and the Royale team. Thank you for everything! We can't wait to come back and work with you all again!"

The backdrop of the wedding and reception was elegant and classy.  We were so happy with the care and attention we received making our wedding feel so special.  The bridal suite was beautiful and the staff made our five teen daughter bridesmaids feel very special with gifts from the hotel.  We can't recommend The Langham Boston highly enough.

        "description": "Thank you for our incredible wedding experience at the LANGHAM. We were married on Saturday, March 26th, and our family and friends are still raving about the hotel ambiance, delicious fare, and the impeccable service provided by your team. \n\nFrom the moment I met with Kerry McGill to consider your hotel, I sensed her \"can do\" attitude combined with her refined approach to customer service. Her polished approach was the first of many interactions that let me know that the LANGHAM was the perfect setting for our wedding. Along the weeks of planning for our day, Kerry kept me up to date via email and telephone to not miss a single detail and, most importantly, kept the communication flowing to not allow for surprises - thank you. Also, her ability to navigate with the various vendors and in-house team allowed us to rest assured that the details were all addressed. Kerry has set an enviable high bar for her role as Senior Catering Sales Manager; we are forever grateful to her, as our day would not have been possible without her.\n\nEqually remarkable is Gladys Obregon; she was all hands-on deck with her experience, skill-set, and team. She has an uncanny ability to listen and ask questions to help construct the vision for our wedding. Gladys is not only an outstanding team member but an equally impressive leader. She, along with Kerry, translated our meeting highlights for the team to note, collaborate, follow, and excel with their service. Just as important is her aura of confidence, which is contagious, especially with her team, most notably Franz and Diego. \n\nWe first met Franz at our menu tasting on February 23rd, and his attention to detail goes without saying. He made us feel that we were in great hands where no point or request was beyond his capacity - thank you, Franz. I cannot speak of the service without mentioning Diego and his ability to set up our wedding. No detail was left to chance, and we loved having that confidence throughout the process. Everyone commented on the outstanding service, and each guest had a specific example where they experienced service above and beyond the high bar set at the Langham. It was refreshing to see that all live up to excellence in service. \n\nStephen Bukoff and Tyra Medina delighted our palate with their delicious interpretations of our menu selections. The menu tasting was one of the most challenging decisions, as all the course choices were a culinary delight. They also created our Rehearsal Dinner Menu and Post Wedding Breakfast and allowed them to be different but equally delectable menu experiences.\n\nKerry Levesque masterfully interpreted our dessert course; she translated our email notes, images, and meeting discussion into our mouth-watering and exquisitely presented dessert trio.\n\nWe could not have been able to highlight all the details of our wedding nor hear them without the technical expertise of Calvin Pratt. He was instrumental in gathering the information needed for our musicians: ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. His vast knowledge base in engineering and technology allowed for seamless audio-visual experience from one space to another. We understand that the floral skylight installation was a first since the hotel's recent renovation. Thus, we wanted it to be beautiful, and Calvin wowed us with his collaboration with the designer, planning, and execution of this unique installation.\n\nAlso, the collaborative efforts of both Caroline McCourt and Amanda Chabot allowed us to have additional professionals orchestrating our detailed wedding weekend itinerary. Caroline's edits and production of our rehearsal dinner menus were much appreciated and noted by our family and friends. And Amanda's review of guest flows before the wedding allowed for flawless transitions from the lobby to ceremony to cocktail hour and then reception.\n\nA welcoming presence on all my visits to the hotel is Johan. He is a charming person providing a premier impression to your hotel: attentive, cultured, and always at the ready to assist with client needs – an extraordinary gentleman! \n\nOn our wedding day, I bombarded the lovely Alisha at the Front Desk with questions and requests. She was calming and confident with her approach and responses – thank you, Alisha, for your wonderful disposition, especially on March 26th. \n\nWe had many needs for our suite: a salon for the stylist to prep some of our guests, a first look pic backdrop, and an oasis to relax. Julie Federman, who is very knowledgeable and understanding, provided her insight into the various room floor plans that allowed for the best suite choice.\n \nLast but certainly not least was the reservation mastery of Michael Hogarty; he was the ultimate caring professional given last-minute requests for additional rooms. Michael, Emily Proctor, and the concierge team choreographed the delivery of guest floral arrangements and personalized notes with the utmost perfection.\n \nAs you can tell from our recollection of the wonderful LANGHAM team member experiences, we think the world of each one of them. We plan on hosting small get-togethers at your hotel, whether at GRANA this upcoming Easter or impromptu's at The FED, and Stephen's next big birthday, so we can hopefully see familiar faces and say hello and thank them personally.\n\nAgain, a sincere heartfelt thanks to you and your top-notch team. We are forever grateful for your collaboration with us to make our wedding vision a reality. \n\nWith much appreciation and thanks,"

The wedding ran as well as we could have ever hoped! It started with the cocktail hour where the atmosphere was perfect and service was, again, exceptional. We moved into the main dining area where the room was beautifully arranged. The timing of everything was like clockwork – everything moved along very smoothly and nobody ever felt rushed at any time. The food was perfectly prepared and served; and it was delicious. \n"

We just want to thank you and your team one last time for everything you did to make it such a special occasion for us.  Each meal was amazing - we received so many compliments about the food - it was just delicious.  The dinner Friday night was a warm and welcoming gathering for our families, which was just what we wanted after not being together for a long time.  And the party on Saturday night was a blast!  The room was beautiful, the Poke bar was a smashing success, it was the right call to have the games in the room, and everyone had such a good time.  Everyone who helped us out was so professional and kind - it really made the whole weekend spectacular.  Please extend our gratitude to everyone who worked with us that weekend.\n\nI am also very appreciative of how you planned the events with me - being flexible with all the changes and paying attention to all the details.  I honestly can say that I would not have wanted to change anything.  The weekend was perfect!  "

From the time we checked in and had snacks and wine delivered to our room, to coming back Sunday night to champagne and chocolate covered strawberries, to the morning with the most delicious lemon ricotta pancakes we have EVER had, the service at the BHH was AMAZING. FLAWLESS! PERFECTION!!! (You NEED to try the pancakes by the way. They melted in our mouths!) Everything ran seamlessly all thanks to you and the wonderful staff at the BHH! The service at the reception was top notch. We had a few people come up to us telling us how professional the staff were. That usually at weddings they see young, inexperienced, staff but not at this event. That everyone was often offered more wine, another cocktail, or if they could get them anything at all. Ben and I had two WONDERFUL servers who kept offering us drinks, more food, water, and asking us often if there was anything they could get us. I wish I could have them follow me around every day for the rest of my life! We felt like absolute ROYALTY! Everyone was RAVING about how nice the hotel rooms were, how gorgeous the hotel lobby was, how eager the bellhops were to help, how beautiful the venue was, how delicious the cocktails were, and how TASTY the FOOD was! Even our most discerning guests mentioned how delicious the food was. Many were surprised how fresh and perfectly cooked the fish was for an event of 150. I had the steak and it was better than any of the steakhouses Ben and I have been to in Boston. The added special touch of you remembering Ben wanted to replace his sides, and we wanted to try a side of ravioli was really impressive. You were SO MUCH FUN, so detailed, so organized, and just unbelievable to work with. I was so relaxed on our wedding day because I knew I was in great hands. You made my day so much less stressful, and I couldn't thank you enough! I could go on FOREVER about this weekend. Ben and I have been NONSTOP raving about everything. Before I forget, THE CHAMPAGNE TOWER WAS INCREDIBLE! Our photographer said she has photographed 3 champagne towers and 2 of them were disastrous. It was SO cool how the champagne flowed down, filling up each glass, and not getting even a drop on the table cloths. I can't wait to send along the pictures when we get them back! THANK YOU SO SO SO SOSOOOOOO MUCH MICHAEL!!!!!! We will definitely stay in touch, and Ben and I will be back as soon as possible for another dinner at the BHH (that tuna on the scallion pancake. SO good!)"

All of our guests were from out of town and we wanted to ensure that everything was taken care of for the entire weekend. The Boston Harbor Hotel was the most perfect venue for our wedding, from the guest accommodations and event venues to the staff and food (oh yeah and THE VIEW!!! ☺ ) To say I was a nervous bride is an understatement but Michael and his team was so easy to work with, they could not have put me more at ease. The different event venues offered at BHH are unparalleled, each with their own unique style and view of the Boston Harbor. We hosted our ceremony and reception in the Wharf room, which meant that the staff had to flip the entire room during our one-hour cocktail party. I continue to hear from guests about how impressed they were with the absolutely FLAWLESS transitions from one location to the other. The food at BHH was also top notch. Since we had so many events at the hotel, we literally went though every item on the menu. Michael and his team set up a private area for my husband and I to take a break after the ceremony and try all of appetizers our guests were having at the cocktail party. I was always told that on your wedding day you won’t be able to eat any of the food, this was not true at all! The food was so good that I ended up trying a little bit of everything. We had steak and lobster for our wedding dinner, which was perfectly cooked for all of our 180 + guests and I continue to receive praises from guests about the Peking duck carving station at our rehearsal dinner. We are looking forward to returning to BHH for our anniversary!"

        "description": "Having stayed at the Boston Harbor Hotel previously, my husband and I were very excited to tour this location when searching for a Boston wedding venue. We knew from prior visits that the setting is beautiful, the service is top-notch, and the food is beyond compare. Upon deciding to book the BHH for our wedding, our high expectations for this venue were well surpassed! Our experience began with Michael Boivin, our wedding coordinator. Michael was with us from our first contact with the BHH through the wedding evening, even taking care to deliver my heirloom veil safely to our room. This small detail exemplifies the service at the BHH. Michael is well known throughout the Boston wedding industry as the best in the business! On top of everything he coordinated within the BHH, he was able to put us in contact with high-quality vendors for services including flowers, lighting, etc., which was immeasurably helpful. From the second you pull up to the hotel until the moment you leave, you are greeted by the friendly faces of employees who want you to have an amazing experience. Michael Boivin, Jennifer Lammers, Laura Furfaro, and everyone we worked with consistently went above and beyond to make our dream day a reality. The setting of the Boston Harbor Hotel is a truly unique one. The backdrop of the harbor is beautiful, and our guests enjoyed watching planes, boats, sunrises and passers-by throughout their stay at the hotel. The central location makes it easy to visit other Boston attractions, catch a game at the Garden, or eat at one of Boston’s famed restaurants. For a fantastic meal, however, you need go no further than the BHH itself. We wanted our wedding guests to have a delicious meal at our wedding. Months later, we are still hearing from friends and family that this was not only the best wedding meal they have eaten, but one of the best meals they've ever had in general! The wedding menus are filled with so many mouth-watering options that it was difficult to choose just a few for our menu! We were pleased to find flexibility in the menu options as well – unlike other venues we had toured. From the service to the ambiance to the food, we could not be happier with our choice to host our wedding at the Boston Harbor Hotel. The motto of the BHH is “Beyond Compare,” and throughout our wedding process – from initially reaching out to Michael, until we checked out as newlyweds – our dreams for a perfect experience were exceeded. We are so grateful to everyone who helped us throughout the process, and are looking forward to visiting again soon"

Our guests commented repeatedly about the delicious food, incredible view and the warmness of the staff. Any time I looked around, someone from the waitstaff was smiling and ready and willing to assist. It was such an effortless way to send off our guests for their travel plans after our wedding weekend. We truly appreciate how you guided our event. Our stay at Boston Habor Hotel was an amazing backdrop to the wedding itinerary."

Both Laura and Karly went above and beyond to accommodate us and our families. Karly was incredibly organized and responsive and pulled together the most amazing weekend for us (all within 9 days)! Our guests were blown away at how seamless the whole day was and we couldn’t imagine having had our wedding anywhere else. I’d recommend Karly and her team to anyone looking for a beautiful wedding venue!"

The staff- from the parking attendants, to the waitstaff, to the concierge are all so friendly and helpful. The event management staff were INCREDIBLE. They go far beyond their job description, giving guidance and advice, and handling every question and task with utmost competence and positivity! They worked with my husband/family and I to ensure that we were getting everything we wanted and still staying within our budget. They covered every single little detail- things that you would never think of, and reviewed those details with us several times before the wedding. The tasting.... one of my favorite days! The staff makes you feel like royalty! The food was amazing, however if there was something you didn't like, you could literally speak to the head chef and discuss tweaks to make it better for your personal taste/event. Every moment of planning and preparing our event at the Intercon was so enjoyable, thanks in huge part to the staff. As part of hosting our wedding at the Intercon, we were able to stay in the most beautiful suite- such a great perk. On the big day, there was literally no stress. Everything was handled... and even when it \"wasn't\", the staff made you believe everything was under control, and made sure that they handled it without worrying you. After our ceremony (off site) we returned to find our coordinators literally carrying my dress, helping the photographer with seating/lighting, keeping myself and my family hydrated during pictures... anything you can think of- they did it. During the reception (which by the way was GORGEOUS), the staff made sure that we stayed on track with our timeline, that we always had a drink in hand, and kept us in the loop with what was going on without being overbearing. There was not one single thing that we had to worry about all night, all we had to do is enjoy ourselves. I could go on and on. Our wedding at the Intercon turned out better than the dream I have always had. Choose the Intercontinental Boston. You will not regret it"

Throughout the entire process, we worked with Nicolette Ortiz and Chanel Goldberg and I couldn't have asked for a better team. They were both extremely attentive and detail oriented and helped make our day that much better! Everyone at IC Boston was friendly and accommodating - from the check-in staff at the front desk to all of our servers and bartenders at the reception - 5 star service all around. The venue treated our families and our guests with the utmost respect and made the evening special for everyone involved."

At the very beginning of the wedding planning process, we were having a hard time finding a venue. However, the second we stepped into the InterContinental we knew right away this was the place!! The bell hop (I believe his name was Adam but I may be wrong) was so excited to greet us. He seemed genuinely happy to have us there! Then, we met Nicolette, the wedding/event coordinator and we were sold!! Aside from just being awesome, she went ABOVE & BEYOND the entire wedding process, and made everything so seamless and easy. She promptly answered my texts and emails any day and hour of the week! All of the staff at the InterContinental were so incredible and helpful. They really are top notch when it comes to customer service. I'd also like to give a shout out to Robin who was our waitress at the tasting, and then at our post wedding breakfast, and a couple other times throughout. She was so great!!! The food, the customer service, the amenities, the rooms, EVERYTHING was perfection at the InterContinental Boston. Thank you!"

He's the reason we chose the venue after talking to all of the downtown hotels. Responsive even at the quote stage, and had suggestions and worked with us to get exactly what we wanted. The evening was perfect. All in all, every single person that we worked with at the InterContinental was fabulous. oughly 120 of the 140 guests we had flew into Boston for the wedding and you really cannot beat the location on the waterfront, near the Greenway, near Faneuil Hall, a short walk to the T and so on. The accommodations in the rooms were lovely and our parents were both upgraded to suites for their stays. Adam, the concierge, was extremely knowledgeable giving our guests information about the city and attractions/restaurants. As for the venue itself and the way the ceremony, cocktail hour, dinner and reception all were held were absolutely perfect. The set up was flawless (especially for having only 60 minutes to flip the entire room from ceremony to reception). All of our guests claimed it was the most beautiful wedding they have been to and everything was perfect!"

Right on the greenway park and right on the water, we knew it would be a big hit. Everyone at the hotel was a treat to work with. Karly and Paul kept everything seeming simple for us since we are both super busy. I know a lot of details went on behind the scenes during the wedding plans and we like how low stress our planning process was. They got all the details perfect even the special meals for some of our friends. They helped us with the bags we wanted to give out to our friends and family staying at the hotel. Their concierge Adam was so helpful in handling some last minute questions from people because of the weather. The entire staff and hotel was extraordinary for us. They treated our friends like family and I know many have even stayed there since our wedding."

The classic beauty and elegance of the space along with the attention to detail and service separated the venue from every other we visited. Lindsay was instrumental in making our day exceptional and we would have been lost without her. Lindsay and her assistant Anne made the planning process easy and enjoyable. In terms of the actual wedding weekend, I don't have words to do it justice. From the moment our guests arrived at the valet for cocktail hour to the moment they left the after party, they were taken care of. The entire Four Seasons Boston staff is professional, attentive, and friendly. The food was absolutely incredible (still hearing from our guests about much they enjoyed it!), the service was exceptional and the space was stunning. We honestly, cannot say thank you enough to Lindsay and the whole Four Seasons Boston team for making our wedding weekend the time of our lives. Thank you, thank you! We cannot recommend the venue enough and look forward to many future stays and visits to the hotel"

We met with Jim Peters at this property and he quickly won my now husband (also in events) and I over. Jim's imagination is unreal and we knew we could trust him to bring our vision to life. It's been 2 years since that original meeting and over those years we've stayed at the property numerous times. We've become so close with their staff that they now seem like family. From Zach and Brian at valet, to Willie and Luis in the lounges, Chanel and Philip in special events, Kat in accounting, Betty and Vuk in catering and Lian in housekeeping. We've met and have fallen in love with them all. Not only was the theme of my wedding executed perfectly last night, the food was outstanding and my guests have been nonstop raving about the palpable hospitality of this team. From A-Z they nailed it and I can not be more thankful. "

He referred us to excellent vendors with whom he worked closely to make the planning and the event run seamlessly. The service given by every department head, down to the waiters was impeccable and our guests said that this was the best wedding they had attended. The food was fabulous and the beef tenderloin was tender enough to cut with a fork. The evening was topped off with a decadent endless dessert buffet that was spectacular"

Finally, we took a tour of the Four Seasons and instantly knew that it was the venue we had been looking for. I can’t believe we wasted time looking at anything else. The Four Seasons Boston is beautiful, classic elegance. Philip was great to work with throughout the entire experience and the whole staff was so professional and accommodating the day of. We felt like they listened to what we wanted and surpassed every expectation. Our guests raved (and still do) about how amazing the food was and so our only regret was that we were too nervous to truly enjoy the amazing dinner."

        "description": "Hosting our wedding at the Four Seasons was an unbelievable experience. The level of service is world class. I know they have planned weddings with budgets that far exceed ours and they gave us the same amount of time, attention, and courtesy as I imagine they do all of their clients. They were able to work with us to develop a wedding that was completely what we envisioned and within the budget. Jim Peters was on top of every single detail. In the months and days leading up to the wedding I didn't have to worry about anything slipping through the cracks - I knew Jim and his team (Shelby, Scott, Joseph) were completely on top of things. On the day-of Jim worked with my parents, our band, florist, string quartet etc., all I had to do was show up and enjoy the day. Throughout the process Jim was able to offer great advice and suggestions for everything from room setup, to food and the schedule of events. The facility itself is gorgeous. The food is amazing. A significant number of our guests traveled to Boston and the Four Seasons was the perfect setting for a family reunion - people raved about the hotel location, their rooms, the Four Seasons staff, and how much fun they had hanging out at the Bristol or up in the spa/gym. Additionally, the entire hotel staff went out of their way to help our guests. A perfect example of this occurred 48 hours before the wedding when my husband's wedding band was shipped directly to the hotel. He discovered the jeweler cut the ring too small and he couldn't get it on his finger. The hotel staff immediately located a trusted jeweler put him and his parents in the house car, and by the end of the evening, the ring was fixed. We cannot thank the Four Seasons Boston enough for hosting the best weekend of our lives!"

It provided a spectacular conclusion to what already was a fabulous wedding weekend. The food was unbelievably good, with an interesting variety. More than one guest has said that it was the best brunch they had ever eaten. Others talked about the pleasure of trying every single different dish. We held the event in the very attractive Governor’s Room. It was nice to have a light and bright space after the evening and night events of the day before. The contrast was really pleasant. Finally, the staff was truly nice, going out of their way to serve and provide for all guests needs. Highly recommend."

Meg Garruto is a true gem and was a dream to work with! We were actually booked at another venue and after some issues we decided we needed to find another venue and actually booked Long Wharf site unseen. Our original venue not working our was the biggest blessing in disguise. The attention to details and the accessibility to answer any questions we had was above and beyond. There was absolutely no stress in wedding planning thanks to Meg and her team. We also were so impressed with the food! From the cocktail hour to late night snacks everything was perfect. Our guests have been raving about the service and the food for the past week! The location of the hotel and the views are worth booking for alone. If you are looking to book a Boston area hotel for your wedding I would seriously consider booking long wharf before it’s too late! We are already looking into visiting for our one year anniversary (and we are not locals!) because we love the hotel so much!"

        "description": "The Marriott Long Wharf was the PERFECT location for our August 2022 wedding. From our initial conversations with them all the way through the wedding, the events staff were incredibly professional and made us feel so special throughout. We had an extended engagement due to the pandemic, and worked with multiple event planners, but each one was wonderful to work with, and each handoff was handled impeccably. In the final stretch leading up to the wedding, we worked with Alex Garabed (Director Of Event Planning), who was highly communicative, flexible with specific and last-minute requests, and coordinated all of our details and vendors wonderfully. She went above and beyond, leaving champagne and strawberries in our hotel suite at the end of the evening, and ensuring that our floral centerpieces were saved to decorate the brunch space the next morning. On our wedding day, the service was perfect, the cocktail hour incredible (we highly recommend checking out the Harbor View Terrace), and the reception was amazing. Our guests really enjoyed the uniqueness of the venue and that they had the option of spending time indoors on the dance floor or outdoors enjoying the fire pits and harbor views throughout the reception. The food - from the tasting to the wedding day - was also absolutely delicious. The wedding suite overlooked the harbor and made us feel so special. From the beautiful venue, to the downtown Boston location near public transportation and many attractions, the comfortable accommodations, and the incredible service we and our guests experienced all weekend, we couldn’t be happier with our choice."

The venue itself is breathtaking with beautiful guest accommodations to grand lobby to view over the Boston Harbor. Our event manager was so thoughtful and kind and very quick to respond to emails; overall amazing to work with. She made us feel like our wedding was her #1 priority at all times. The food was mouthwatering...our guests said it was not only the best wedding meal they've ever had, but one of the best meals overall they've ever had. Our out-of-town guests loved how it was close to everything and had the quintessential Boston feel. If you're looking for a venue in the heart of Boston, this is it!!"

        "description": "Kaci was fantastic, we would be totally lost without her. We had never planned a wedding, or an event as big as this, before and we literally did not know where to start. She answered every question right away and provided excellent detail. She checked in with us pretty much every step of the way, starting from when we originally booked the event, and was with us until the very end. She made herself available late at night to accommodate my schedule, and I truly feel like I could not have planned this 200+ wedding without her. Laura Fox was also amazing to tour with and assist with billing. When we first looked at the Marriott she was the only person out of every venue that we toured that asked us how we got engaged and personal questions about ourselves. Right away we felt like we were in good hands. Laura showed us every corner of the Marriott including the rooms that our guests would be staying in, and we're glad that she did because we ended up using almost every single function room available. We had follow up questions regarding billing throughout this process, and Laura was responsive and made herself available whenever we needed her. One of the things that we stressed when we were touring the Marriott was we wanted our event to have good service, and the service staff was beyond our wildest expectations. I used to work in the service industry and I was blown away by how attentive every waiter for each particular table was. My dad went to the bathroom when his food was being served and his waiter kept his food hot and literally waited until he sat down to serve it to him hot. We saw the service staff carrying trays with over 10 entrees to a table, which looked insanely difficult, just to ensure everyone was served at the same time. We also saw our waiter cleaning up the dance floor at one point because someone spilled a drink, which was definitely not his job but highly appreciated. We knew the service would be good but we did not know that we would be dealing with the best in the business. They were the ultimate professionals."

The team we worked with, especially our coordinator Olga were extremely professional, organized and attentive during the planning process and on the day of the event. Everything went seamlessly and we didn’t need to worry about anything on our wedding day. The team really went above and beyond to make our special day everything we hoped for and more. We hadn’t been to many weddings and Olga really helped us to plan everything out and consider the details so that everything was perfect. We are very grateful for her attentiveness and detail orientation. Thank you!!!"

        "description": "Get married here. Seriously. You will not be sorry you chose the Commander. Judy, the events manager, is the most amazing person. She helped us through every step of the process, had great ideas, was super responsive, and was an overall delight to work with. Now that my wedding is over, I'm a little disappointed that I won't be able to hang out with her any more! The staff at the Commander were consistently friendly, attentive, efficient, and just so nice! From bellhops to waiters, everyone rocked! And the food! The food is outstanding! Over 140 meals were served on time, with no guests waiting around. I'd recommend the devils on horseback for cocktail hour. The Commander only takes one wedding at a time, and it shows! The hotel itself is beautiful, with lots of historic touches and a George Washington theme. The rooms are comfortable and spacious. You can't beat the location in Harvard Square, 5 minutes from the T. My favorite banquet rooms are the Lexington and Concord rooms with amazing original windows, which is where we hosted brunch. So many guests kept coming up to the groom and I to tell us how much they loved the food, the staff, and the hotel. I cannot sing the praises of the Commander loud enough!"

        "description": "I have to first state that I have not had my wedding reception here, and this is the reason why: Our original wedding date was in June, but due to a personal situation, we postponed our wedding. Judy was unbelievable to us. She was extremely sensitive and understanding and went as far as to recommend someone who could help us, and not because she was looking to make money from us, but because she truly cared. Fast forward a couple of years later and we have a new date set. I immediately e-mailed Judy because I still loved the space and wanted to work with her. Unfortunately, the dates that our church was available did not line up with what was available at the Commander. Judy did everything she could to try and make it work. Although I have yet to be able to use the Commander for events, I would recommend them to anyone because of how above and beyond Judy goes for her clients. She never once made us feel embarrassed about our situation, never pressured us, and never tried taking advantage of us wanting to come back."

When we ran into a couple of bumps along the way you instantly responded and reacted to assure us that you would do everything possible to correct it and just wanted to make sure we were happy with everything.  We appreciated the many hats that you wore throughout.   \n\nYour whole staff from the wait staff to the maintenance and room setup were all so friendly, professional and accommodating.   \n\nThank you again, we definitely would recommend the Sheraton Commander to our friends and family and look forward to coming back to see you again soon.\n"

Victoria is over the moon!\n\nWe’ve received so many wonderful messages from our friends and family of the venue, amazing food, and the famous Judy (who was everywhere making sure everything was perfect)! \n\nPlease give our thanks to the Chef and culinary team-- they knocked it out the park and brought the flavor! We had friends ask us if we had an outside caterer because they expected to be served mediocre hotel food, and when we told them that the hotel catered the event, they couldn’t believe it! We can’t thank the Chef enough for being creative and customizing this special meal for the party. Thank you to you too for the suggestions on the menu and making it all come together. Special thanks to the housemen and banquet staff for making sure the set up was perfect and that everyone was taken care of.\n\nLastly, special thanks to Dawn for always being available to answer questions and follow through with the event!\n\nWe appreciate everything you did for our daughter’s Quinceañera! Magnificent job Sheraton Commander!"

We had our reception in the Charles View Ballroom, which had gorgeous views of the Boston skyline. In addition to the stellar views and facilities, the food was phenomenal and the team was great to work with (shout out to Robert!). No detail went unnoticed and the day truly went off without a hitch. We are so happy we decided to host our wedding here and can’t recommend it enough!"

        "description": "We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect venue for our wedding than the Hyatt Regency Cambridge! Karie Duran was an absolute gem throughout the entire planning process. She is the epitome of professionalism—so organized, supportive, and genuinely dedicated to making our vision a reality. Her insightful perspective put us at ease not only on the big day but also during the lead-up to it. On the day of the wedding, we were fortunate to have Roger on our team. He was amazing—keeping us hydrated and attentively catering to our every need. The two of them made a dream team, often anticipating our needs before we even realized them. The food was simply outstanding! The Hyatt’s culinary team truly went above and beyond, crafting a menu that perfectly matched our tastes and impressed everyone. The rest of the Hyatt staff mirrored their excellence. Every single person we interacted with was friendly, smiling, and ready to help, creating an atmosphere filled with good vibes. We’re already looking forward to celebrating our anniversaries here to commemorate the stunning event the Hyatt helped us create. If you’re considering a wedding venue, look no further—this place is simply exceptional!"

From the moment of our first visit, Caroline and all of the staff at The Newbury were attentive to our every need (and my many emails/questions). Friends in the planning process would ask me if I had done this task or that, but The Newbury truly does everything - it felt like an all inclusive venue. The Newbury utilizes Major Food Group for food and drink and I can truly say it is the best food I've had at a wedding - everything was cooked to perfection and hot and the drinks were amazing. They had wonderful house linens, tables/chairs, and china, but have easy options for rentals if you wanted to change something. For other vendors they have a curated list of who they recommend/who has worked in The Newbury and whoever we decided to work with Caroline coordinated with them to make the day perfect. From wanting to bring six people to our food tasting to answering 20 emails about room blocks or anything in between, Caroline was there for me quickly and always professional and with a helpful response. She truly felt more like a trusted friend than someone working for The Newbury, and she gave us the wedding of our dreams with truly no stress. I cannot say enough about Caroline and the rest of The Newbury staff and the business they run - choosing The Newbury as our wedding venue has been the best decision we have made"

A great time was had by all and so many of us did not know how to play. I had a concern about the distance between our office and PKL but it did not make a difference and well worth the trip. A big thank you to the entire staff."

The staff was so welcoming, kind and helpful. The service was exceptional. All of our guests commented on the tremendous service and wonderful food. Those lobster tacos though... You should get married here just for those...:) The venue was classic, tasteful and elegant and you are steps away from the Public Gardens for pictures. Ralph, our coordinator, and his team were top notch. I would not hesitate to book the Ritz if you are looking for the perfect city wedding!\n"

        "description": "There aren’t enough words to describe how amazing our experience with the Ritz-Carlton Boston was for our NYE wedding. From the initial site visit, through the entire planning process, up until the day we left after the wedding, we felt like royalty and never once questioned that our wedding wouldn’t be amazing. We planned our wedding from out of state, and Bobby-the sales coordinator—was so accomodating and helpful. We flew back to Boston for a quick weekend visit and he managed to have us to the hotel for a beautiful tour, complete with a mimosa toast! Once we decided on the venue, Ralph took over as our event coordinator. He was fabulous. He managed to help plan every detail of our wedding without overstepping or overshadowing our vision. Ralph pays so much attention to detail and kept us up to date and focused as the day got closer. He helped us plan for our tasting and various vendor visits, even though we live 1,000 miles away. The night of the event was like something out of a fairytale! We felt like celebrities walking into the hotel, everyone from the doormen to the housekeeping to the caterers were excited and ready to celebrate with us. The Ritz prides itself on service and attention to the customer. They truly outdid themselves, always refilling our drinks, checking in to make sure we were comfortable, and keeping our night going as smoothly as possible. Some names I’d love to mention include Bobby and Ralph of course, Joanna (our server for the evening, who made sure we always had a full signature cocktail!), doormen Steadly, Godwin and Kenny. Bartenders and servers Rubin, Marvin, Jose. Other staff including Hannah, Courtney and Jack. I’m sure there are countless others who congratulated us in passing, left a note for us to come back to in the bridal suite, or were willing to run around to make sure our day was perfectly executed. The Ritz staff had me in happy tears when we arrived back to our room after the magical evening and found our bridal suite adorned with chocolate covered strawberries, a bottle of champagne, cards from the staff, a PRINTED PHOTO from our ceremony in a custom frame, monogrammed bathrobes and personalized pillowcases!! I mean COME ON!!!!!!!! :) :) :) We 1000% recommend this venue for any couple wanting to have a fabulous and stress free wedding in the heart of the city!!!! You won’t regret your choice here!"

        "description": "We looked at A TON of wedding venues before deciding on the perfect spot. We knew we wanted a hotel in Boston, but there were so many beautiful places to choose from. The Ritz was our final stop and we fell in love IMMEDIATELY. There was something about the Ritz that made us feel valued and cared for. Bobby was waiting for us with 2 glasses of champagne and a big smile as we walked in. He took his time showing us around and answered every question we could think of. He was willing to personalize every detail of our dream wedding and right away we knew we had found what we were looking for. The chef prepared us a signature appetizer while we toured the hotel and even had a special dessert with our names on it (literally!) as we were getting ready to leave. Needless to say, Bobby had us at hello. The rest of our experience with the Ritz was just as amazing. Vanessa worked with us throughout the 10 months leading up to our special day and took care of every question and request we threw her way. She was amazing - very calm and patient - which is what I really needed :) Paige was just as wonderful - they worked together very well to give us everything we needed. The wedding weekend was a dream. We had a beautiful suite for 3 nights, as did our parents :) The hotel staff members were so kind and accommodating. We are so grateful to everyone, especially the valet staff! Danny was with us from day one and we looked forward to seeing him at the door every time we made the drive up from New Jersey to meet with Vanessa :) The wedding day itself could not have been more perfect. It was everything I imagined and I couldn't believe how gorgeous everything looked. After a year of worrying and planning, it was such a great feeling to sit back and look at the final product. We could not have done any of it without the Ritz-Carlton. I can't imagine having our wedding anywhere else. Choose the Ritz! It is worth every penny. We will always remember our experience. It was simply perfection - right down to the elegant display of flowers and framed 8 x 10 photo that was waiting for us in our suite the night of our wedding. Vanessa and Paige managed to capture the most amazing picture of us stepping out of our limousine and somehow had it printed and framed during our reception! We will Cherish these memories forever. Thank you to everyone at the Ritz, we could not be happier!!!"

        "description": "The two of us work and manage hotels in Las Vegas and were excited to find a hotel that we could truly trust every detail with for our special day. The bride is from Boston we shared our first dates in Boston and knew we wanted to find the perfect location for our Boston/New England wedding celebration.\nWe were looking for a venue with excellent service, a venue that was sophisticated yet modern and elegant that did not feel like a hotel conference, and offered special Boston attractions within walking distance. With many luxury hotels within Boston, The Ritz-Carlton, Boston was by far delivered the best first impression that would exceed any couples expectations. We toured six within the city! We planned to have 142 guests, and loved that we could host a ceremony, reception, and social after the wedding in the same location for out of town guests. We wanted our guests to feel relaxed and enjoy their experience as much as us. Ralph was our senior event manager, and was proactive and responsive with every detail. He is a true professional, seasoned with many weddings under his belt and offered great recommendations to make the space fit and feel perfectly for us. The entire process from inquiry, to tasting, to the weekend of our wedding was flawless. During our tasting in March (for our September wedding), our parents happened to mention that they too, were celebrating their anniversaries in the month of September. Six months later, both sets of parents received a special anniversary dessert in addition to our wedding cake that they continue talking about to this day. You’ll also notice how much is included in the various wedding packages and made decision making easy when planning to host our special day at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston. The hotel is newly redesigned after a multi-million dollar renovation and offer great accommodations, and suites, with the club level being a great addition for last minute waters or snacks the day of the wedding for those guests that select that service. The ballroom also recently redesigned offers great floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Boston Commons, beautiful chandelier and décor neutral but stunningly beautiful that allow flexibility for any décor, taste or budget. Not only was the ballroom beautiful, the chiavari chairs, plates, charger plates, silverware and glassware were of the quality you would find in a high end steakhouse. We had our ceremony in The Washington Ballroom and offered perfect floor to ceiling windows, a great entry flow for our guests to enter, and was intimate but not overly crowded to have a wonderful ceremony. We selected to have a pianist, cello and harp player and the acoustics in the room were great. The natural light offered beautiful lighting for excellent photos. Our cocktail hour was in the foyer to the Grand Ballroom, and the service continued to be spectacular. The full bar set up flowed nicely with nice areas to set up high cocktail round tables overlooking the city below, with great passed hors d’oeuvres (great presentation, what was meant to be hot was hot, what was meant to be cold was cold) and had a great selection that everyone loved. Service the day and evening of our wedding was incredible. Nearly every guest commented on how attentive the ballroom servers were, with perfect and personalized service, always making sure plates were cleared quickly, beverages were always filled, and made everyone feel like true VIP’s. The three course meal with designer boutique wedding cake were prepared perfectly, tray-passed prosecco upon arrival was fantastic and timely and added a great detail, and the flow from the ballroom to cocktail hour to reception was easy and perfect transitions for the chapter of the day. Without delay, we would highly recommend The Ritz-Carlton, Boston. With the perfect location next to the Boston Commons and Rose Garden, to the personalized service for you, your wedding party, family and friends, to the perfect ballroom with excellent food and service, the hotel and event management are unmatched in the heart of Boston."

Welcoming, respectful and responsive they helped to insure our daughter and son in-laws wedding was perfect. From the doormen to the chef, event planners and coordinators every person was exceptional. Our wedding guests were wowed by the food, the service, and the venue.

        "description": "The entire event planning experience with The Ritz-Carlton Boston was absolutely incredible, and a month after the wedding, our guests are still talking about how amazing the wedding weekend was. The venue – especially after the ballroom remodel – is absolutely beautiful, and was the perfect canvas for our wedding. Allison Breslin & Vanessa Michaels made the entire process seamless, and ensured our wedding was a dream come true. Our positive experience started with the initial site visit with Alli, and once we started planning, Vanessa worked with us for months to plan every last detail. She helped us throughout the planning process - from putting together our production schedule / timeline, coordinating catering, communicating with our vendors, and during our wedding weekend was amazing - ensuring our check in & guests' check in went smoothly (early check ins when possible & gift bags for everyone!), reserving space for us in the Avery bar post-rehearsal dinner, making sure all wedding decor was where it needed to be, and overall, making us, our parents, and guests feel special. Once the wedding began, she did everything she said she would and more – from the moment we checked in a few days before, to the morning after the wedding. Throughout the planning process, I never once was concerned as I knew Vanessa – and the entire team at the Ritz - would ensure everything went seamlessly, which it absolutely did. I’d 100% recommend the venue to any New England bride!"

Decorated from to bottom in ethereal fine art, the space's focal point features a beautiful hall with evocative imagery that creates a one-of-a-kind experience for the viewer.\n\nWe had a vision to create a sacred space and artistic experience by transforming a former Masonic temple into a temple of the arts. Canvas by canvas we created our dream. Every wall and ceiling area has been hand painted and curated by us. The countless paintings make this 'house of muses' both unique and alive. Upon entry you will feel the special energy that permeates the space. Hundreds of visitors each year call it a palace and are uplifted by its peaceful energy.\n\nWith stunning cathedral ceilings and great acoustics, the building measures up to 10,000 square feet of exquisite craftsmanship. The ground floor has a dining/lounge area with an adjacent commercial kitchen. The upper floor features an open floor plan in the main hall. There you will find beautiful cathedral ceilings are adorned by artwork, each telling a story uniquely their own.\n\nExotic wood-carved doors beckon the visitor into the lounge area, along with oriental rugs and other handcrafted sofas featuring tribal scenes. The heart of the space features a stunning hall that is a favorite backdrop for photoshoots, filming, and audio/video recording.\n\nThe house has 2 large fireplaces, 3 bathrooms (which productions use as a backdrop), a huge dining area",

        "description": "The Artists for Humanity EpiCenter played host to what ended up being a dream wedding for my wife and I. Looking at venues in Boston for 250 people was a bit disheartening until Artists for Humanity was recommended to us. We knew we didn't want a hotel ballroom wedding and AFH offered us the perfect canvas. The space itself is beautiful, I'm sure you could spend thousands of dollars brining in lighting and flowers but it's entirely unnecessary. The rotating art installations are all incredible and we loved the cafe lighting that AFH offered.\n\nFor our wedding we worked with Kristina and she was excellent. AFH has an exclusive catering agreement with Gourmet Catering which may sound limiting, but in the end I think was a blessing. It's clear that AFH and Gourmet have their events down to a science and Kristina worked extremely effectively with the Gourmet team. Kristina and AFH also went above and beyond, providing us with easels to use during the setup and additional supplies (tables, etc...) that we would have otherwise needed to purchase ourselves. Overall we got everything we wanted and more from AFH as a venue and Kristina as a coordinator."

It's a large 2 floor open space with updated art ranging from paintings to sculptures to using everyday items, such as car windows and strategically placing them as guard rails for the lofted second floor. The events I've been too have been catered with plenty of room for many vendors and floor space for dancing if necessary, which in my opinion is always necessary. I could envision this space being used also as a unique and beautiful reception venue."

The level of professionalism, patience, and attention to detail they all showed, both on the day of and all the months leading up to it, are unmatched. Our ceremony was held in the Italianate Garden followed by the reception in the Hunnewell Building, and we worked with Tastings Caterers - who I also can't recommend enough. All of our guests said our wedding felt like a fairytale and we wouldn't have changed a thing!"

The grounds are absolutely beautiful and we got so many compliments from our guests about the unique venue.

We had an amazing wedding day and could not have imagined it anywhere else!"

It helped that we had perfect weather, but Chelsey and our caterer William walked us through the rain plan, and they were prepared to make it as beautiful as possible. We had our ceremony at the Italianate Garden, cocktail hour through the Bressingham Garden, and our reception in the Hunnewell building and attached tent. Everything was breathtakingly gorgeous. Although Elm Bank doesn’t have a day of coordinator, Chelsey was so helpful during the planning process. She coordinated with our vendors during the weeks leading up to the wedding and answered questions when they came up. I do recommend hiring a day of coordinator to help with the flow of the event day. Elm Bank is a truly unique and perfect venue! We highly recommend it! "

Lindsay, Chelsey, and the rest of the staff at Elm Bank were extremely responsive, flexible, and kind throughout the planning process. A special shoutout to Chelsey, who asked us thoughtful questions during the planning process that helped us stay ahead of the curve, and consider things we wouldn’t even known to think of. The grounds were stunning - I grew up near the venue and have visited many times, but it was somehow even more breathtaking for the wedding, and especially so at sunset and at night. Elm Bank has a variety of beautiful settings to hold a ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception, and provided golf cart shuttling to our family members would needed assistance getting around. They worked extremely smoothly with the caterer, coordinator, and DJ to make everything perfect. One final note and thank you: one of our guests had a small health incident after the ceremony and the Elm Bank staff was exceptional at helping her. We can’t thank them enough for reacting quickly, accommodating our guests, and going above and beyond to take care of her. Truly, Elm Bank was everything we wished for and more!!"

They take such good care of their grounds, and make so much attention to detail. They are also pretty open to any extra vendor you would like to use. We had a private painter, a string quartet, cotton candy vendor, gelato vendor, and photo booth vendor. We also hired a day of coordinator and they worked very smoothly with them. Every time we talk to one of our wedding guests all they can do is rave about the evening and the venue. The days following our wedding we saw so many of our guests post their own little photos shoots they did before the ceremony and during cocktail hour. They loved taking photos in all of the gardens. We don’t blame them! They all looked great! The folks at Elm Bank made us feel like their #1 priority the entire way. They were very thorough with every vendor and every detail. They most certainly did not disappoint. The relationships they have with their preferred vendors are strong, and they work extremely well with each other. It was very impressive. We can’t say more nice things about Elm Bank. If you decide to have your wedding here you will not be disappointed!! Thank you! "

However, Lindsay was great and provided us with pictures of the gardens in July, as well as some key details about how the day would look. Once we saw the pictures, we were hooked, and it was a great choice. Even through a staff transition when our original Venue Coordinator went on maternity leave, the Event staff at Elm Bank made things smooth and painless. At our walkthrough, Chelsey made sure we had planned for all the details, explained their beautiful and detailed rain plan, and asked questions about small things we hadn't even thought about. Leading up to the day, she was responsive and helpful when it came to our putting together a seating chart and finalizing other details. On our wedding day, the entire staff at Elm Bank worked to ensure our day went smoothly and that everyone was where they needed to be and had what they needed at any given time. "

        "description": "We could not have asked for a more beautiful venue than Elm Bank for our July wedding. We had visited the gardens a couple times prior to the wedding — never in the summer — and that day, we were blown away: the grass was perfectly mowed and all the flowers were in bloom in the Italianate Garden and around the property. We had our ceremony in the Italianate Garden, cocktail hour in the Belvedere Garden, and our reception in a tent on the Maple Grove. So many of our guests remarked on how stunning the venue was, and how much they enjoyed walking in and around the grounds. Elm Bank was the first and only venue we toured before putting our deposit down. We worked with a full-service wedding planner, so my husband and I didn't liaison much with the coordinator staff at Elm Bank, but in what little interaction we had, they seemed very kind. The day of, they were very helpful and even let us pick up some things on Monday morning when they weren't officially open. Some things that we would've liked to have known while we were considering venues. These weren't deal-breakers, but just FYIs. - You have to source all your alcohol through a provider called Gordon's. They had good selection, and you're able to return any unopened cases of alcohol (this was great). - Because it is a nonprofit center, they're not open at all hours of the day, so we had to pay a bit extra for labor costs so install the tent/lighting/catering, etc. in a shorter amount of time. - For the ceremony, because of the way that gardens are laid out, we had to place the chairs around the flower beds and bushes, and some of them were farther away from the altar. I think it was difficult to see from some of the seats in the back."

Not only did the Tiffany Ballroom have all of what we were looking for included, they had tiers of vendors you could add in which removed so much stress of having to find flowers, cake and a DJ (all of which were so wonderful to work with!!) They also have great relationships with so many local vendors which made the process of finding everyone else super easy! We had a lot of out of town guests attend and they all spoke so highly of the hotel and everything it has to offer. A little rain on our wedding day was not going to stop us from having an amazing time! Mindy made sure we were still able to get photos outside and the set up for our ceremony inside was perfect! Overall, wish I could I relive this day again because everything turned out how we wished it would thanks to all staff at the Four Points Sheraton!"

        "description": "The Tiffany Ballroom at the Four Points was truly an amazing venue for our wedding! We got the privilege of having Jayme as our go-to person for everything leading up to our special day. Jayme was truly, without a doubt, outstanding. Everything from her communication, personality, experience and dedication, we knew Four Points and having Jayme as our go to girl, it was the perfect fit for us. Jayme made everything as simple and fun as possible for us and helped us every step of the way. The food, the DJ (we hired the DJ Four Points typically uses), the coordination, staff and everything was beyond our expectations. The venue itself is impeccable from the ballroom, bathrooms to the outdoor patio. We could not have been happier with the dedication, support and experience we had here. I highly recommend them as a venue for any and every event you may have."

I appreciated that she checked in on us throughout the entire process. Choosing a package made everything a lot easier and a lot less stress. All the vendors included in the packages were great. All the staff at the hotel were nice and friendly, especially the concierge. The food was delicious and the guest loved the options that were offered. Compared to other venues in the area, this was the best choice for a reason."

Jaime was amazing, very responsive to all our questions, honest, and willing to incorporate all the merging cultural traditions between my family and my husbands family into the ceremony and reception. Every guest commented on how well the cultures blended and how well the whole day went. I recommend the biggest package because it ensures you have the flowers, cake, dj, and the on-site catering already set and we really only needed to pick out makeup/hair and photographer. I could not recommend this venue and Jaime enough."

We worked with Mindy and she was amazing from beginning to end of the planning process, helping us create the perfect event in the Zachariah’s dining room. The package that the Four Points offers is unbeatable. All of the vendors included (Cake, DJ, Flowers) were top tier and made the wedding planning process as stress free as possible. So many of our guests couldn’t stop talking about how great the food, drinks, and cake were, but most importantly, they continue to talk about how great the staff was throughout the hotel. As the bride, I can say that Mindy and her staff (especially Jeffrey and Jean) went above and beyond all day to make sure we had what we needed. THANK YOU for helping us make our perfect day a reality."

        "description": "Jayme was incredible to work with and the Tiffany Ballroom was a stunning ceremony and reception location for our special day! All of our guests complimented how amazing the food was (they are still talking about it) and were blown away with the level of the white-glove service they received during the reception. When we started searching for a venue last year, we really wanted to book a location that offered a \"full package\" to refrain from reaching out to handfuls of florists/bakeries/DJs etc, and this fit the bill perfectly; while also being within our budget. I will say, we had to go out of package with each of their vendors to achieve the look and feel we wanted for our day, which is just something to be mindful of if you too have a specific color palette/theme/look you're seeking. Jayme was fantastic in this aspect with her level of communication to our vendors and the execution in setting up our reception hall to achieve that overall look for us. Our hotel block was fully booked by our guests and I'd also like to note that almost everyone looked for us the day after to share how incredibly clean/comfortable/and lovely their stay was. Overall, I highly recommend The Tiffany Ballroom for an on-site ceremony and reception area."

    "description": "A Remarkable Achievement in the World of Theater Restored to its Stunning Original Flourishing State.\n\nIn 1927, when vaudeville circuit palaces were at the height of their evolution, the Citizens Bank Opera House was one of the best examples of this type of venue that could be found everywhere. Theatrical productions from all across the world can be seen here, many of which have won prestigious awards. Since it was brought back to its former glory, the Opera House has been the source of unforgettable moments for each and every one of our visitors.\n\nThe entire theater, the stage, or any one of our many beautiful event spaces are available for booking for parties ranging in size from 20 to 2,600 people.\n\nWhen it initially opened its doors in 1928, the Boston Opera House was known as the B.F. Keith Memorial Theater.\nThomas White Lamb, who was considered to be one of the most accomplished theater architects of his era, was responsible for the luxurious movie theater's architecture, which was a fusion of the French and Italian styles. Late in 2004, following a number of transitions in ownership, the Boston Opera House underwent an extensive period of restoration and renovation in order to meet the requirements of large Broadway touring plays. The theater has a capacity of 2600 people, and in addition to hosting regular performances by the Boston Ballet and Broadway productions, it is also open for pre-show use and private functions.\n\nPlease get in touch with us if you are interested in holding your event at the Boston Opera House or any of the other venues that are affiliated with our company.",

Sonsie, which is open seven days a week, has lovely French doors that open to a sidewalk cafe in the summer, as well as a European lounge with deep leather chairs and sofas. The mahogany bar, staffed by an experienced group of friendly bartenders, serves the best martinis in town, and the brick oven cranks out eclectic pizzas all day. It's easy to unwind at Sonsie and listen to the classic music that reflects the restaurant's ambiance as the day turns to night.\n\nWe have a variety of options for private, corporate, and social events such as birthday parties, rehearsal dinners, baby showers, anniversaries, and other special occasions. Take a look at our lovely Private Wine Room and start planning!\n\nChef Kyle Wallace was born and raised in Chester, New Hampshire, a small town just south of Manchester. Chef attended a boarding school in Vermont and developed a new appreciation for slow foods and farm to table cooking. He later returned to Vermont to attend the New England Culinary Institute's Culinary School.\n\nChef Kyle finished his internship at Cambridge's Harvest. After that, he moved to Maine and worked for a short time at Natalie's Relais Chateaux Property before returning to Boston. Chef moved around a while before settling down at Jody Adams' Porto in the back, where he rose through the ranks to Executive Sous Chef. Chef Kyle was later elevated to Chef De Cuisine and transferred to Jody's flagship restaurant TRADE in the Financial District, where he remained until the Pandemic struck.",

    "description": "Our Mission\nWe are a nonprofit innovator and guardian of iconic venues, providing relevant and inclusive performing arts entertainment and cultural educational experiences for the most diverse audiences possible.\n\nVision, Values and Background\nThe Boch Center has ignited a greater appreciation for creativity as an essential component to our society for generations and is home to Boston’s iconic Wang and Shubert Theatres, which have anchored the historic Theater District for 100 years. We believe it is a right, not a privilege, for all individuals to access the arts regardless of background or means. We believe the arts heal, transform lives, and create opportunities for expression, dialogue, and shared cultural experiences. We believe the arts keep us a civilized society, and accessibility, diversity, equity, inclusion, and civic engagement are among our highest priorities. Our staff and Board leadership reflect the communities we serve because we believe diverse perspectives fuel compassion and innovation and help us see beyond our past experiences and toward the future ahead of us.\n\nLocated in the fashionable theatre district in downtown Boston, the Boch Center offers a lively setting\nfor a variety of special events and meetings in both of our venues.\nRestored to its 1920’s elegance, the Wang Theatre is a marvelous historic landmark that is able to\naccommodate intimate gatherings of twenty to full-scale events for several thousand. Picture your next\nspecial event; gala fundraiser, wedding, festive event or corporate meeting in the spectacular Grand\nLobby, with its one hundred foot (100’) domed ceiling, grand staircase, fifteen-foot chandeliers and\nopulent decor. Modeled after the Palace of Versailles, the Grand Lobby will make your guests feel like\nroyalty. Consider a new product introduction or a national sales incentive meeting in the lavish 3,562-\nseat theatre. In addition to being one of the largest stages in the country, the theatre offers a unique\nopportunity to hold an elegant dinner or thematic celebration gala right on stage. During a pre performance reception, watch the crowd stream into the Grand Lobby from your vantage point at an\nintimate cafe table in the Encore Terrace - an ideal setting for a gathering of up to 90 people.",

Take a seat at the dark stained bar, admire the custom glass work, and enjoy a drink with over 60 premium whiskeys to sample and a bar staff that boasts the “perfect pour” of Guinness.\n\nIf you’re looking to sit down for a meal, there is a more reserved dining room that features vaulted ceilings, a rock facade, cozy leather booths, and full-length windows that open to the plaza.\n\nLooking for a more private dining experience? Check out Arthur’s Lounge — which was named after Arthur Guinness, the Irish entrepreneur and brewer of Guinness beer — located off the bar area and perfect for large dinner parties.",

    "description": "There are four levels to this building. In the center of Boston, there is a footprint. The splendor of the Gilded Age will make your heart skip a beat. The Tower is a soulful venue. With a wistful brilliance that is both subtle and eternal, it keeps watch over Boston. The Tower is overflowing with a Gatsby-like zeal for life, fuelled by LONGWOOD'S passion for extraordinary events. She can accommodate up to 400 guests and is a blank and historic slate.\nSet the tone with a cocktail in the sumptuous First Floor Lounge, which is perfect for networking and private dining. Original brick walls and wood ceiling beams add elegance, character, and history to the space. Conversation is sparked and guests are encouraged to engage in comfortable fireside seating areas.\nElegant, vintage chandeliers hang from high ceilings in the Second Floor Parlor, casting an ever-changing light that floods in through antique elevated windows. The space's nobility is enhanced with gilded age sculptures and beautiful woodwork, providing the ideal backdrop for your formal banquet or black-tie gala.\nThe Green Room on the Third Floor is Boston's best-kept secret. Our Green Room is a day or night private area with plenty of possibilities for an underground dinner party, small gathering, or high-stakes private meeting. During a raucous gathering above or below, the Green Room also provides a modest and private location for retreat.\nThe Fourth Floor Library is where intrigue meets elegance, inspired by the great stories of the past. Original bookcases adorn the walls, inspiring heartfelt events like charity galas and award ceremonies, where ambitions are as big as the stories on the shelves. Your tale is waiting for you.",

To meet your demands, our experienced sales managers will offer a variety of personalized menus, package options, and private and semi-private eating rooms.\n\nThe Boston Fogo is located in Copley Square, across from the Boston Public Library and just steps away from Trinity Church and the Hancock Building. The location is great for both inhabitants and visitors. Fogo Boston features many private and semi-private dining spaces that may accommodate groups of 10 to 100 people. All dayparts have different menus, as well as full-service catering and contactless takeaway and delivery choices.\n\nFogo de Cho's founders grew up on a traditional Serra Gaucha farm in Southern Brazil. They learnt to cook in the churrasco grilling tradition, which would later become the story's backbone.\n\nIn 1975, the founding brothers moved from Rio Grande do Sul to Rio and São Paulo to pursue official churrasqueiro training while also establishing the Fogo concept.\n\nThis original restaurant, built of wood and tucked in the Porto Alegre countryside, arose out of an obsession with quality, investments in the city's art and culture, and a reverence for the founders' families' heritage. The Fogo concept was transplanted to the United States, with a stateside debut in Dallas, Texas, at the request of devoted American guests. Since then, the restaurant has expanded greatly thanks to a reputation of delicious food and exceptional customer service.",

    "description": "Tiki Rock events are usually unique and unforgettable. Please complete the form on their website and they will contact you as soon as possible.\n\nTiki Rock has been serving classic and proprietary tiki cocktails crafted with fresh juices, handmade syrups, and unusual garnishes at 2 Broad St. Tiki Rock, which launched in Boston in 2018, blew any leftover winter blues away with a barrage of the best tiki drinks. It features tiki-style totem poles, bright blue bar stools, orange banquettes, and hand-painted scenes.\n\nFreshly produced juices and syrups are available in the central bar, complementing a menu of fun and classic tiki-style cocktails.\n\nA bright beacon beckons in downtown Boston if you're seeking for a break from the cold and perhaps more ice this weekend. Eater Boston reports that Tiki Rock debuted on Broad Street earlier this week.\n\nTropical rain falls against illuminated Polynesian figures in Tiki Rock's entryway, flanking a carved wooden door. There are bright blue bar stools and orange banquettes inside the dining room, as well as hand-painted images by Boston artist Joanna Ciampa, carved tiki-style totem poles, and a wall of scallop shells collected by Straub's mother in Chatham.\n\nTiki Rock is the idea of general manager Christopher Straub, who took over The Place's former location at 2 Broad St. and hired Moe Kuroki to run Oisa Ramen in the adjacent space. Straub brings years of Hyatt Hotel experience to the project. As beverage director, Charles Smedile (Uni, Clio, Waypoint) comes on board, as is chef de cuisine Matt McPherson (South End Buttery, Porto) and sushi chef Minggan \"Tony\" Wu.",

    "description": "Garage B at the Speedway is the finest event rental venue serving all of Greater Boston from its highly accessible Soldier's Field Road location, with a huge open floor design, beautifully textured concrete walls, and high ceilings with exposed steel roof trusses.\n\nGarage B can accommodate up to 240 people standing and 160 people seated and is a lovely blank canvas for weddings, family gatherings, corporate events, and community gatherings. A bank of movable, glass garage doors leads into a manicured patio/outdoor space that may be tented and integrated into your event.\n\nIn America, the end of the nineteenth century was the golden age of urban park creation. Following the success of architect Frederick Law Olmsted's Central Park in New York City and the Emerald Necklace in Boston, there was a worldwide drive for additional recreational activities for city people, spurred by the assumption that access to fresh air might alleviate a litany of societal ills. The Metropolitan Park Commission (MPC, now the Department of Conservation and Recreation, or DCR) was founded in Massachusetts in 1893 with the purpose of constructing the country's first interconnected regional park system.\n\nGarage B will be offering discounted pricing for events throughout the summer. Contact Jenna Chilington, our Event Sales Coordinator, at jchillington@charlesriverspeedway.com or events@charlesriverspeedway.com, or fill out and submit the form found on our website to learn more about hosting your event at Garage B. Check out our FAQ and Pricing Information, both of which are accessible as PDF downloads. We can’t wait to work with you on your event!",

    "description": "Whether you're planning a work outing, a wedding party, or a private event, HAVA gives you plenty of options to personalize your venue and make your idea a reality. Our venue has a one-of-a-kind environment that allows you to design the ideal celebration for your special occasion.\n\nJohn Stefanon of JFS Design Studio, a well-known interior designer, designed the interior of HAVA Lounge. HAVA Lounge's design elements were influenced by a significant attention to history and emotion. Originally intended to serve as the theater's ladies lounge and orchestra area, this stunning space required subtle elegance reminiscent of the era.\n\nThe glamorized cues of HAVA Lounge are visible from the moment you walk in, with its \"Victorian Chic\" décor. Bold dramatic declarations of shapes and patterns, balanced and juxtaposed in Jing-Jang form, bring a unique vibe to this historic Boston jewel.\n\nAs you move from the Main Lounge to the Back Lounge, the HAVA Lounge's mood is elevated, and a more surreal style is introduced to what used to be the orchestra pit area. The theme of \"moths driven to a flame\" called for dim lighting and components that would transport consumers to a pleasant summer night on Shanghai's streets – or to a faraway fantasy locale.\n\nBoth lounges were designed to generate an exciting sense of motion within time and fantasy.\n\nWe provide a number of customizable options, including as DJs, catering, video and audio, security, bar and servers (for Age Appropriate Events), and more, to help you create a one-of-a-kind, unforgettable event for up to 380 people.",

As a wedding planner planning her own wedding, my fiance and I were looking for a venue that was unique and spoke to us, but also one that had extensive experience with the intricacies of running a wedding. Natalia and PEM ticked all of these boxes, along with being such an incredibly beautiful building, and an experience that our guests will never forget. Natalia was with us through the whole process, toured us through the space, gave our parents a second tour, and let us come by as much as we needed to plan out our ideas. She was even there overseeing the set up on our day, and made sure to check in with us! Even as a functioning museum having many rules to protect the art, they always worked with us to be as flexible as possible and offered us solutions as needed. We loved our whole experience, and love that we can come back and visit our wedding venue anytime :) Thank you to the whole PEM team, and especially Natalia!"

Natalia is an amazing coordinator that helps bring your wedding vision to life. My husband & I, along with all of our guests, were blown away when we saw the reception room on our Wedding Day (the lights, flowers, décor, setup, etc!) – there were a lot of WOWs! We decided to hold our ceremony at the Immaculate Conception Church which allowed us to do a “Second Line” where our band (American Midnight Band – highly recommend!) played a sax/drum while our guests danced through the streets of Salem (behind our horse and carriage!) from the Church to the PEM. Not only does the PEM blow your guests away in the pure beauty of the Museum but holding your Wedding in Salem brings another level of fun and creativity for what you can do. Our guests raved about the food as well (short ribs and salmon!!). We are SO HAPPY we chose PEM as our Wedding reception venue."

        "description": "We cannot recommend the Peabody Essex Museum enough! My husband and I had the chance to celebrate our big day at the museum this past September, and the entire experience from start to finish was flawless. Natalia, the coordinator for the museum, was the epitome of professionalism and was on top of every single detail and deadline. She took our panicked calls with grace, and her vast experience helped immensely in ensuring a completely flawless execution on the day-of. We cannot thank Natalia and the rest of the staff at the museum enough! Also, while the pictures certainly showcase the beauty of the venue, it must be experienced in person. From the various galleries, halls, garden and atrium, this is truly a unique and beautiful venue unlike any other. Pair that with the perfect location in downtown Salem, with multiple hotels and restaurants within walking distance, makes for an incredibly convenient venue. Overall the Peabody Essex Museum is an amazing spot and we could not recommend it enough!"

Prior to the wedding, Natalia and Ana were there to answer any and every question we had. We were also able to schedule multiple visits to go over wedding day logistics. We selected to have our ceremony in the main atrium, cocktails in the garden atrium and reception in the East India Hall. Our guests loved that they were able to view artwork as they walked through. They also commented on how wonderful the dinner service and waitstaff was. I wouldn't change one thing about our wedding and highly recommend the PEM as a venue for anyone looking for a unique experience for the wedding party and guests."

I'm so happy we were married there. Our reception was inside Carriage House. What a cool place that really transports you back in time. The grounds were beautiful to take places also inside the mansion. A special thanks to Linda DeFranco who is nice/sweetest person and worked with us before and the day off. She was able to come up with a way to do the ceremony inside with a thunderstorm approaching. Gore Place is a special place to get married. It's a great spot not too far from Boston, easy for guests to come and enjoy!"

There are a number of areas on the grounds that would have worked for the reception, but we decided to do so in the field in front of the mansion right by the big apple tree. Despite being right off the main road through Waltham the trees and greenery made it feel like we were in a remote countryside estate. The carriage house had the rustic look we were looking for but was still fully functional for everything we needed to hold the reception."

Though we really wanted to use the SPECTACULAR carriage house, our daughter insisted on using the tent, having always fantasized about an outdoor party. And, we had such a wonderful day at this spectacular venue. Everything was perfect. We were able to walk into the beautiful tent (thanks for the lights!) and be full guests at our own party. Thank you doesn't even begin to express our appreciation for all they did for us! Gore Place made our entire family (and all our guests) tremendously happy."

Our original venue could not hold our wedding as planned and we had to look for a new location to hold a very small ceremony with our immediate family and friends to become legally married. From living in Waltham and passing by the beautiful grounds of Gore Place, we decided to inquire if they would be available to hold our ceremony. We met their wedding coordinator Linda to take a tour of the grounds and could not be more pleased with our experience. Linda was attentive and empathetic towards the current pandemic that is affecting so many weddings this year. She truly understood how brides and grooms are feeling during the pandemic and wanted to help in any way that she could. She gave us a tour of the grounds and the options we would have for our ceremony. Gore Place is so expansive and has multiple different options. Given that our wedding was in late October, we had no idea what we would be dealing with for weather, not to mention the state’s limits on guests, both inside and outside. Gore Place offered three different locations for our ceremony (outside in the field, outside under the tent, and inside the beautiful Carriage House) and we now had three options to help us with weather. We left our meeting with Linda and knew immediately this was the place we wanted to get married."

        "description": "We've been attending the annual Sheepshearing Festival at Gore Place the last few years and knew it was a gorgeous place to take a walk close to our home in Belmont. When we got engaged Gore Place was on the shortlist of potential venues we wanted. It offered everything we wanted: outdoor ceremony location (with a covered location as a backup) and indoor reception space with air conditioning. The Carriage House was renovated in the last few years and is just beautiful, and we were able to take some gorgeous photos inside the historic mansion. Linda was so personable and flexible and actually recommended both the Justice of the Peace and catering company we ended up hiring. It is an amazing value as a venue because you have so many options and they have tables and chairs on-site so you don't have to rent them. Highly recommend!"

We planned our wedding from out of state and Linda was so kind and helpful along the way. She did a face time meeting with us, met us in person a couple of times, and communicated well over email. She was there on the day of the wedding and was so kind and helpful along the way. We loved getting to have food trucks pull right up to the big white tent for dinner and dessert! The bridal party got to use a room inside of the mansion for our getting ready finishing touches, some picture taking, and signing our ketubah. What an amazing venue – we’re so happy to have gotten married at Gore Place!"

We instantly fell in love with the beautiful and historic grounds, the mansion and the rustic appeal of the newly renovated carriage house. I had my heart set on a fall wedding and couldn't imagine another place to do it. It was also a plus that it is very close to Boston and fit into our budget. Our beautiful fall wedding day turned into a rainy fall day but Gore Place lends itself to multiple options, all of which made for a beautiful wedding and fun reception. We are very grateful that we were able our special day there and would recommend it to anyone planning a wedding."

We did our ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception here and they have so much space for all 3 to feel like they are in separate areas. You get all of the grounds to yourself for the whole afternoon/evening and a massive tent (with a floor) comes with the cost. The grounds are also so stunning, full of green and flowers.

Everything flowed perfectly from ceremony to cocktail hour to reception. Most importantly, what we didn't realize when booking is that by booking the library we received our fairy godmother in Paige. Paige is absolutely amazing and took so much of the stress of planning our wedding off of us! She gave amazing recommendations, made sure all the food was exactly how we wanted it, worked with us as we made changes and helped us use some of the library's decor for free. At the end of the night, she made sure everything was packed in our car and ready to go. She wrangled our large family at the rehearsal (no easy task) and made sure my husband and I were attended to our entire wedding night. Paige alone makes booking the library completely worth it, the beautiful venue and amazing food are just icing on the (delicious) cake! Thank you, Paige, for all your help!"

We had just over 100 guests and it was the absolute perfect size. Not only is the layout of the venue perfect, but the historic details are jaw-dropping - so many amazing photo opps! It is in close proximity to many great hotels downtown. Their bridal suite upstairs is also amazing and a great place to get ready/dressed before the big day!

From the time we booked the library in May 2016, Lisa was there for everything we needed even if we did have a year and a half before the wedding! When Kacey came on board we began communicating more with her. She was extremely responsive to emails, answered even what I thought were silly questions, and gave reccomendations from her experience. October 2017 came quick and at our final meeting I knew we were in good hands with Kacey. She is AMAZING! The day of the wedding was better then my husband and I could have ever imagined. Everything ran smoothly and our guests are still raving about the decor and the amazing food. Kacey did an amazing job keeping the flow going and making sure everything was on point. All of our vendors were amazing as well. They all worked together to make sure the night ran smoothly. If you are contemplating the library for your wedding, DO IT. it was the best decision my husband and I ever made.

Planning with Lisa and Kacey was an absolute breeze and I couldn’t have had a more invested and special team-they make the couple and their families feel completely at ease. There was nothing cookie cutter about their work-they remember the smallest details, answered what I sometimes thought were the craziest questions in an email, and shared the same level of excitement about our wedding as I had! You can’t duplicate a team like theirs.\nMorin’s Catering was beyond! Since none of our family was from Rhode Island it was important to us to capture everything Providence in that weekend and our custom menu from Morin’s Catering was just that! The lobster rolls and fried dough were huge hits! Lastly, there was something magical about the venue itself. We had both our ceremony and reception there but changing the furniture, Ormonde lightning colors, and the gallery feel made every portion of the night unique! HIGHLY RECOMMEND the library for a once in a lifetime experience!"

From the beautiful ceremony to the fabulous hours d'oeuvres (lobster tater tots, bacon wrapped figs, and Gorgonzola baskets!!!) to the incredible dinner (one of our guests was a chef at a Boston restaurant and he asked for more Shrimp Neptune- that is how good it is!!) to the wonderful passed desserts (lemon cupcakes, root beer schnapps floats), everything was absolutely delicious and beautifully executed. Robin Hollow farms created beautiful flowers and Ormonde Productions did an amazing job. At the end of the night, everything was done and we were able to head out to enjoy the after party. We received multiple comments that it was the most beautiful wedding our guests had attended. We also heard wonderful feedback on the food. Typically, wedding food is mediocre. That was most certainly NOT the case. Morin's did an incredible job. I cannot say enough about how perfect the wedding was. It surpassed my expectations on every level. Thank you for a wonderful evening!!!"

Christina was our coordinator through Russell Morin's Catering — she was so responsive and kind throughout the entire planning process, answering every question we had and working with us to make the day ours. From the tasting and menu selection process, to the design details from Ryan Designs, everything was so clearly communicated and made it easy to make decisions. We truly didn't experience any of the typical wedding planning stress because we knew the team at Russell Morin's would handle everything we needed during planning on and our wedding day. The venue itself is absolutely stunning and feels like you're in a fairy tale - it is truly a hidden gem in Rhode Island for folks looking for a stunning and unique outdoor waterfront venue! The food and drinks were amazing, and our family and friends told us all night that it was the best wedding they've been to (and are still reaching out to tell us!!). We truly cannot imagine having planned a wedding without Christina and the Morin's/Mount Hope Farm team!"

The Barn is a beautiful space with the lovely outdoor ceremony spot, and was a great fit for our 85 guests. Thank you again to the staff at the Mount Hope Farm and Russell Morin!"

We set up corn hole and was a very laid back atmosphere. The service was exceptional and they were very attentive to us. Our reception was in the Rustic Barn which provides a cozy feel . There is also a fireplace in the barn as well if your looking to do a ceremony in there as well. Kelsey and the fellow staff are great to work with and answered questions I had with a quick response.

The wedding venue also comes with an amazing coordinator named Elizabeth. We could go on and on about how much we love Elizabeth, but the three main things that stood out us, was her attention to detail, communication and enthusiasm. She also goes above and beyond to communicate with all of your other vendors to makes sure everyone is on the same page the day of the wedding. Lastly she has some incredible vendor recommendations for transportation, music, floral etc. Don't think twice about Shining Tides, BOOK IT."

Shining Tides is a hidden gem right on the water that is secluded away down a beautiful road past a golf course in Mattapoisett. Elizabeth who is the venue coordinator was absolutely fantastic to work with! From the first venue visit in 2019, to postponing in 2020, to finally having our dream wedding last month, she was along for the ride and could not have been more helpful, professional, and thoughtful during the process. The venue itself is stunning, the ceremony and cocktail hour are on a big lawn right in front of the water and the reception with an amazing ocean breeze coming through when dancing. The caterer for the site, Russel Morin was incredible! The best part is that this is a YMCA property (you would never know besides the sign on the main road) and your fee for the venue goes back to the Y! I am so happy that I chose Shining Tides and that we were finally able to celebrate with friends and family at our dream venue. Hurry and book your wedding here ASAP!"

I was disappointed I did not have the tropical wedding we had originally planned due to covid but I had a good feeling about this venue. It was honestly a dream come true and we were just so happy with everything. Elizabeth, the venue coordinator, was so helpful and gave me a list of vendors to choose from (all of which were awesome). The catering was absolutely phenomenal and although I was initially concerned about spending so much on it, it was so worth it and the food and service were absolutely spectacular. I couldn’t have asked for a better place to celebrate our marriage with our loved ones!"

Throughout the entire process Elizabeth was incredibly supportive, flexible and attentive. All of our vendors came from her recommended list, and they were all outstanding. We absolutely loved the location of the venue and needed minimal decorations because everything is so beautiful to begin with. An added bonus which was not even on our minds originally was that the entire venue is considered to be outdoors. Our guests felt relaxed and safe celebrating throughout our wedding day in 2021 because of this. The water views are stunning, there is always a breeze, and the staff was incredible. We couldn't recommend Shining Tides more! Everything exceeded our expectations."

I’m a pretty controlling and high maintenance person at times so I was definitely worried about things looks perfect.. I was literally shocked at how perfect everything was .. the lighting came out just as I had hoped, the views were unreal, communication was spot on. The nice thing about shining tides is that it’s really just a beautiful shell and you can do whatever you want with the space! You can do everything on a budget or opt for some classier higher end options.. it’s not a cheesy one size fits all venue. Highly highly recommend! Plus, the catering company they use is soooo good. Definitely on the pricier side but everyone said our food was the best they ever had at a wedding!"

Elizabeth, her recommendations, Russell Morin ( the caterer), and the rental company were all amazing. I would highly recommend them, and I love that the venue rental money goes to the YMCA for such a wonderful cause."

        "description": "My wife and I got married at Shining Tides in August and given that RMCE is the exclusive caterer of Shining Tides, we had the extremely good fortune to work with Krista, Yasmin and the entire RMCE team! There are so many reasons you would be making the right decision in choosing RMCE as your caterer but let's start with the most obvious one: the FOOD. When I say the food knocked our socks off, I mean it wholeheartedly. Being two food-lovers, the food for our guests was extremely important to us for the big day. Needless to say, when we went to our tasting with RMCE, it completely affirmed what we already believed to be the case; the hors d'oeuvres not only looked amazing, but also tasted amazing (we had mini fish tacos, arancini, \"big mac\" beef wellingtons, and lobster chips, among other amazing passed items), the mains were perfectly cooked as well, and the dessert options were equally delicious and so artfully made. Our guests were raving about the food all night! Then of course, there's the staff, who were absolutely amazing. Krista at RMCE was a dream to work with leading up to the wedding; she is kind, helpful, detail-oriented and deeply invested in making sure everything goes off without a hitch! Her and Elizabeth from Shining Tides worked very well together and made us feel totally at ease in the months leading up to the big day. Similarly, Yasmin, our day-of-coordinator, was just as wonderful to work with and worked tirelessly both before and throughout the big day to make sure everything ran seamlessly. And lastly, the entire RMCE catering staff was so great. Having worked in catering myself, I know it can be a stressful, fast-paced and at times thankless job, and we were just so impressed and humbled by how kind, efficient and professionally they all worked throughout the night. Our RMCE wedding attendant, Judy, was constantly checking in to make sure that both ourselves and our immediate family had all the drinks, hors d'oeuvres, and desserts we could handle, and it just meant a lot to us to be able to say hi to all of our guests while still being able to enjoy the amazing food and drinks we had picked out. All of this is to say, going with RMCE will be the best wedding vendor decision you could make and we truly could not be happier that we had the chance to work with Russell Morin!!!"

Getting married in 2020 was full of twists and turns, and when faced with stricter guidelines in MA my husband and I decided to relocate to NH. We discovered BVI and signed our contract the night of our first meeting with Brianna George. Throughout the entire process Brianna was extremely helpful, organized and communicative in our planning. She was extremely patient through all of our questions and details (we had to fit a lot in 6 weeks!). The property itself is perfect and lends itself to a \"weekend wedding\" - all of our guests stayed on property, we held our Rehearsal Dinner at the Grand, used the Spa and had a post-wedding breakfast at the Tavern. Our guests loved being on property and made everything super convenient. The reception was perfection, everything stuck to schedule and the food and drink were spectacular! I couldn't recommend BVI enough and we're SO glad to get married at BVI!"

        "description": "We had the most beautiful wedding at BVI. From the moment we walked in, Olivia greeted us with the kindest smile and professionalism. After the tour we decided, we couldn't get married anywhere else, it was the most perfect place for something that felt like a wedding but still had that cozy / intimate feel. Olivia was a godsent, she answered every and all questions I had and made the planning process so easy. Seriously, email after email, anxiety meltdowns, anything she was there for me as if I was the only bride she was working with. I was blown away the day of the wedding how she set everything up in a way I could not even picture, adding in touches that just made it beautiful, and she was truly the calm in the chaos to make the day run smoothly. She stopped my husband helped him with his boutonniere, helped make sure I was okay and reassured me on everything. She also assured our family was taken care of, it's so important our parents and bridal party were taken care of and Olivia and BVI did that. Olivia even helped me make some signs since I was so stressed about this! She is wonder woman, I swear!!! We never felt pushed to go with this venue or to purchase anything, Olivia was actually very forthcoming about pros and cons to different options and what actually fit what we needed/wanted versus what was most expensive. It's evident she cares about the couple, and that is what matters most. She was so helpful throughout and day of she made sure all my vendors knew what they needed to do and helped with anything that came up. She allowed my husband and I to just enjoy the day. We got married in march, I actually preferred to have the ceremony indoors along the beautiful bay windows and it was lovely. We were able to take photos outside because the weather was so nice, taking advantage of the beautiful landscape for day photos and some fun night photos under the bulb lights. The milk room was so nice to be able to return to after the ceremony and eat and drink with our family and friends. The most incredible thing though was that our friends and family stayed right upstairs at the venue and/or right across the way at the grand. Not having to shuttle anyone and having the ability to run upstairs to do a quick change or grab something was important to us and allowed our guests to have a fun and stress-free time. The food was amazing, the drinks were amazing, our families felt it was such a fun and classy wedding. We also had our rehearsal dinner onsite at the room above the restaurant. It was perfect, and I had full faith Olivia would be able to coordinate and help my mother in law get all of the details set so it was one less thing I had on my plate! I could not imagine our special day without BVI and Olivia, it really was so perfect all around, I could not have dreamed of a better day and I cannot thank Olivia and the entire staff. We can't wait to visit in the future and think back on it 🙂 thank you for creating memories we will cherish forever, if you are considering BVI you need to do it, you will not regret it!!!"

I especially want to thank the bridal planners who played such a big role in making me feel comfortable and confident in our planning. I have nothing but good things to say about our experience and would highly recommend BVI to any bride looking to be WOWed and absolutely dotted on on her big day."

We booked almost 2 years prior and of course the thought of covid never crossed our minds at that time, but the staff we worked with made the whole process as stress-free as they possibly could have. Olivia and Melissa worked with us most closely, and they were constantly on top of keeping us informed, giving us options and supporting whatever we chose to do, and working to accommodate our vendors. They were so patient and positive through everything. When a new restriction came up the week of the wedding, they were calling/facetiming/emailing pictures, etc. to let us know exactly how things would need to be changed and to make sure we were happy. When it came to the wedding day, we were so supported by the day-of coordinators who also went above and beyond to make sure everything went smoothly. The reception staff even handled a rowdy guest situation so professionally that the groom and I had no idea anything had ever happened. Despite all the unexpected that came along with covid, our rehearsal dinner and reception were everything we dreamed of and more thanks to this beautiful place and the staff who are so invested in making your day perfect and making you feel as though you're the only couple they're focused on. Thank you for everything!"

        "description": "I looked at so many venues for our wedding, and BVI was the only one I kept coming back to on my list and the only one we toured. I wanted a venue that was a little different than a typical ballroom, and BVI has the perfect amount of New England charm. As soon as we met our coordinator, Madison, I was sold! Madison was incredibly helpful during the whole planning process. Anytime I emailed her with a question she’d answer promptly and always with good advice. When we had our final details appointment, I knew I was in good hands. She went through every single thing and made us feel at ease about the big day. Madison REALLY blew me away on wedding weekend, though. I had a very specific vision for the decor for both our wedding and the rehearsal dinner, and she set everything up even better than I would have myself! She is so creative and didn’t miss a single detail! And she was also so kind and we felt like she was truly happy for us and our marriage. Allyson, the group bookings manager, was also so helpful and made the room booking process so easy for us and our guests! Really, the entire staff went above and beyond to take care of us. And we got so many compliments on the venue itself! It rained on our wedding day and I was really sad that we couldn’t have the outdoor ceremony I dreamt about, but having it indoors ended up being beautiful and the staff flipped the room before we even joined cocktail hour! It was also so nice that we were able to have our rehearsal dinner there and have all our guests stay right onsite so we didn’t have to leave all weekend. Our wedding at BVI truly exceeded my expectations and we can’t wait to come back and visit in the future. And one more shout out to Madison - consider yourself lucky if you get to work with her!"

        "description": "My husband and I got married at the BVI on NYE and we may be biased, but aesthetically it was the most beautiful wedding we’ve ever been to. Between the beautiful Harrington flowers we had all over, tons of gold sequin & decor from Dee’s Linens, a midnight balloon drop and champagne toast, the night was seriously unforgettable. If you’re looking for a beautiful, winter wonderland wedding, look no further. Our friends and family were appalled by how beautiful the venue was and how the BVI truly is like it’s own little Christmas town. We did our rehearsal dinner at the BVI as well and it was SO much fun to have friends and family bustling all around the venue, Inn, and hotel all dressed up like we owned the whole place. If you’re looking for a venue that has EVERYTHING on site (which is exactly what we wanted) the BVI works perfectly. Between a beautiful hotel for family (The Grand), The Inn for the wedding party, the venue itself, The Tavern for drinks during some down time, The Overlook room for the rehearsal dinner, the apartments for the rehearsal after-party (if you’re like us haha), and a salon to get ready in with your girls- it’s literally PERFECT. We had our wedding party stay in The Inn and they thought it was so cool how they could walk to each other’s room so easily and could look down at our venue decorated to the nines. Not to mention the food is unbelievable. We got multiple comments on our wedding having the best food of any wedding people had been to. One person even mentioned it was the best filet they’d ever had. The next day 30 person brunch is sweet too, and definitely beneficial if you do an open bar and people need fuel the next day ha! A few downsides we faced- we got word quite a few people had to wait at The Inn front desk for a long time before anyone helped them (after ringing the bell) and often forgot to give them their complimentary champagne. If you’re looking to negotiate prices with a venue, this might not be the venue for you- it’s their way or no way. We loved the venue too much to turn it down due to this, but there is no negotiating. We had an issue with wanting to rent out the entire Inn and apartment suites for both nights- rehearsal and wedding, and due to the BVIs change in employment, they booked out an apartment to a random couple and wouldn’t budge when we wanted this taken care of (this was on the night of the wedding so was kind of a major bummer). Aside from a few complaints, I am SO glad we chose the BVI as our NYE wedding venue. I would send Nicolette super long emails with tons of questions and she would get back to me very timely and thoroughly. She was great! She also worked so diligently with us on special requests- making a balloon drop at midnight happen, sparklers as guests exit, and timing the midnight champagne toast up perfectly. Overall, we had such a spectacular NYE wedding/ party at the BVI!"

Olivia was a pleasure to work with throughout the entire process, never wavering, even with my numerous emails to her. Everyone was blown away by how professional yet personable all staff were on the wedding day. They truly work as a well oiled machine and I would do it all over again with BVI. It poured about an hour before my ceremony, I was devastated when they started setting up furniture for an indoor ceremony. It brings tears to my eyes still thinking about how accommodating they were. They not only set up for both indoor and outdoor ceremonies, but then wiped down all 134 chairs and still got us outside for our ceremony!! BVI, and Olivia, are the best! My husband and I were telling all the tours next day to just book. They have a space you can get ready in on site, the food is delicious, the grounds are gorgeous, and they know their stuff when it comes to food allergies (coming from a celiac bride!). Do it, you won't regret it!"

We considered BVI for our wedding venue but they were already booked!"

From start to finish, the service was first class! Olivia provided us with everything we needed to know on our tour and helped us every step of the way. I know for some couples, non-negotiable holiday decor is a big no but BVI does such a beautiful and tasteful job. We had so many guests coming up to us saying how much they loved the decor and general set up of the Inn. You truly do get what you paid for! The food at our wedding was the best wedding food we have ever had and that's not just us saying it, but nearly every guest said the same thing! My wife and I highly recommend taking a tour and consulting with the lovely staff at Bedford Village Inn!!"

They make everything very straight forward for you with costs and reality of experiences. While prices may seem high at first, you truly get what you pay for! The entire day went perfectly, if there was anything that went wrong I didn't know about it because they work so seamlessly as a staff. During the day itself there is always a staff member around for you to help you with anything you need. You get a personal server with you right after the ceremony to get you and your wedding party any appetizers and drinks you need. They check on you throughout the night as well to continue getting what you need. The venue itself is beautiful. I wish I could properly put into words how wonderful the experience was. I highly encourage you to take a tour and consult, you won't regret it!"

        "description": "Where do I begin? Bedford Village Inn was the only place my husband and I toured as a potential wedding venue because from the moment we walked in we knew it was the one. For starters the beauty of the grounds, the guest rooms, and Great Hall are obviously breathtaking, romantic, and dreamy. However, beyond all of this what made our experience so magical was our wedding coordinator Olivia. Of course she was knowledgeable, creative, helpful, organized, and professional but Olivia felt like family from the start and that made the lasting impression. She was there to answer all of my little/silly questions along the way with a smile. Most importantly, she was there with a calmness and confidence when the weather turned leading up to the wedding ultimately raining on our day. Olivia, along with the day of manager Brittany, were so flexible coordinating with us to make last minute changes and I never felt pressured or stressed. I am so glad we chose BVI to host our special day, as well as our rehearsal dinner. Everything and everyone were so amazing through and through. Oh, and while it did rain we luckily ended up with a rainbow"

Getting married during a pandemic came with a whole set of challenges, and the BVI was there every step of the way to help create my dream wedding in the safest way possible. We cannot say enough wonderful things about how beautiful the space was and how delicious all of the food and drinks were. Guests commented on what an amazing and perfect wedding day it was, and we could not agree more! Our wedding coordinator, Brianna, was instrumental in our planning process. She worked with us and helped us take our 155 person wedding to less than 40 without compromising anything! She was kind, knowledgeable, patient, and SO incredibly helpful. Working with her made a stressful experience so much easier. Thank you Brianna, and BVI, for your part in making our day so special! We cannot wait to come back to celebrate our anniversary for years to come! Best, Lauren & Matt"

It is breathtakingly gorgeous (especially during foliage peak season), reasonably priced, and includes everything you might possibly want or need right on property. The staff at BVI were amazing to work with from beginning to end ensuring our day was as seamless and stress-free as possible, which is not an easy task in the midst of a pandemic. They were very accommodating with our situation in regards to rescheduling/re-planning our wedding 3 times prior at a different venue due to COVID-19. Everyone we encountered there was professional, attentive, and focused on making our wedding the best it could be. If you have Brianna as your event coordinator, know you are in great hands. Not only responsive and caring, but she thought of and accounted for every detail even I didn't think of. She made it her personal goal that everything was exactly as we had envisioned. Our bridal assistant, Brittney was also wonderful- she made sure we had everything we needed, checked in with us just enough without being overbearing, and packed up all of our belongings/décor at the end of the night. Thank you BVI for allowing us to finally have the wedding we have always dreamt of. Without hesitation, I would highly recommend this venue to anyone and everyone!"

All along BVI has been so supportive and accommodating. Their responsiveness has been incredible and they have truly done everything in their power to make sure we are feeling good and still excited about our big day.

We wanted a venue where everything was on-site - lodging for our guests, space for a rehearsal dinner, a place for guests to eat breakfast or lunch while there for the weekend, etc., and BVI truly had it all. In addition, the Great Hall is absolutely breathtaking in the winter months with the holiday decor and coziness. Brianna, our wedding coordinator, was the absolute BEST and assisted with all of our questions and ideas in the months/year leading up to our wedding day. She then worked closely with our day-of coordinator, Shannon, to ensure the day itself was absolutely perfect. From start to finish, we wouldn't have changed a thing about our experience with BVI. Also, we ended up using their recommended vendors for both our florist and DJ, and were so happy we did."

After researching 50+ venues in New England and visiting ~10, the Glen Manor House was by far our favorite.. hands down. We worked closely with Katie who has been with GMH for years and was a big part of the reason why we moved forward with them. Katie is incredibly professional, warm-hearted, easy (and fast!) to communicate with, and knows how to run a wedding like no other. I am so, so happy that we decided to get married at Glen Manor House, and cannot recommend this venue and team enough!"

This venue is absolutely stunning inside and out, it has a chateau vibe, with beautiful grounds and an incredible water view. Our guests were so impressed with the venue and loved everything about it! Everyone loved the beauty, flow and the indoor/outdoor flexibility and could not have more nice things to say about it. We really loved that everyone could truly enjoy themselves, whether that meant getting down on the dance floor, conversing in one of the dinner rooms or enjoying the beautiful sunset and later moon views outside. Working with Katie was an absolute pleasure! She is such a nice person and amazing to work with. She helped us every step of the way in planning , was readily available whenever we needed to speak to her and she provided rapid responses to our e-mails. She took care of all of our items that we dropped off for decorations such as pictures and signs. Our wedding day was absolutely perfect and we HIGHLY recommend and thank Katie & the Glen Manor House!"

Katie who runs the house is amazing and runs it like a well-oiled machine. You just feel like royalty the second you walk in. The high ceilings of spacious rooms that then open up to the ocean and bright gardens are magnificent. There is a very large bridal suite and you are allowed on the property three hours prior to the event so we had plenty of time to hang out and do some pictures before. They have all tables and chairs on site. You need to hire a caterer to come in from their approved list."

The scenery and setting is out of this world. The ambiance is unlike anything else. And Katie is an angel. She was the most helpful vendor I dealt with. So quick with anything I needed. Random questions, also while planning during a pandemic she was incredible. I am so grateful to her. Even setting up/breaking down the event I didn’t have to worry about a thing thanks to her. She helped guide us through our most precious day so wonderfully and effortlessly. And my family couldn’t have nicer things to say either. So thank you Katie and the Glen for making our wedding dreams come true!!!!!"

Between the architecture, ballrooms/dining rooms, gorgeous red carpet staircase and the stonework outside- the whole building is a work of art. I have been to countless weddings and no venue was as breathtaking as the Glen. My guests came from far and wide, all over the country, and I had many of them state that the Glen was the most magical venue they have ever been to. They said it felt like you were in a fairytale. If you are looking for a unique and romantic wedding venue- the Glen is for you! Plus- you can’t beat the gardens, waterview, and pictures on the dock! Now Katie was a godsend. She met with me, my husband and our families multiple times to show us the venue. She was accommodating and was happy to answer all questions. As the wedding got closer she gave me guidance and ideas on how to execute my last part of wedding planning. She even helped with the ever dreaded seating chart. She was always cheerful and positive through my entire experience. On the day of my wedding it was no different. She coordinated drop offs for all our extra items (i.e. pictures, card box, etc.) and ensured it all got placed. She coordinated with all our vendors and made me feel confident that I would not need to do or worry about anything the day of the wedding. Throughout our reception, she checked in with my husband and I and made sure we had everything that we needed. She was one of the main players in making our wedding day perfect. Please do yourself a favor and book the Glen Manor!"

    "description": "Originally designed by world-famous architect John Russel Pope and based on the French Petit Trianon at Versailles, Glen Manor was quite unique to the area. The landscaping was designed by the Olmsted Brothers — sons of Frederick Law Olmsted.

Caroline is creative, knowledgeable, and extremely organized. She and her staff are attentive to every detail and will discuss all options available to you when planning a wedding at Oakholm Farm Estate.The grounds are meticulously maintained and the venue is surrounded by beautiful mature gardens that create a peaceful relaxing atmosphere The main house is available to rent for the bridal party and family. I highly recommend this option. The bridal party enjoyed staying together and getting ready on site. The staff at Oakholm were professional and attentive to every detail. Oakholm is an exceptional choice for an outdoor wedding venue with various scenic spots for photos including the gorgeous gardens and lake views! The weather was perfect for our day but a plan was in place should the weather turn on us. Every case scenario is talked about when planning your special day. We can not say enough about our amazing experience having our daughter’s wedding at Oakholm Farm Estate. Everything was perfect and we could not have chosen a better venue. Oakholm is a truly enchanting place for any celebration."

        "description": "Where do we even begin?! Oakholm Farm Estate was an absolute dream to get married at. From the beginning we knew we were taken care of. Caroline is hands down the best wedding coordinator we could have ever asked for. She made the whole process stress-free. There wasn’t one detail that was missed. The day of, her assistant, Ariana, also made our day seamless. We had a very tight timeline and between the two of them we were able to get everything done. They helped relieve any and all stress we had. We opted to rent the Big House for the weekend and it was the perfect getting ready area. With 6 beds and 6 baths, there was plenty of room for everyone to get ready. The groomsmen got ready down at the cottage by the lake. It was perfect to have them have their own area on the property to get ready. Our ceremony by the lake was picture perfect. They were very accommodating getting our guests down from the parking lot that needed assistance with the golf cart. Caroline and Ariana also worked with us to get our grandparents down the aisle safely by recommending them walking in from a different spot. (They truly think of every little detail) Our reception was everything we could have asked for and more. The team at Oakholm brought our vision alive and it was perfect. Again, Caroline and Ariana made sure we stuck to our timeline, and most importantly, made sure we ate. Ariana then brought us around to all of the best spots for our sunset pictures. The landscaping around the whole estate is absolutely beautiful. I can’t recommend getting married at Oakholm Farm Estate enough. It is hands down the most beautiful venue!!"

    "description": "For any private event in downtown Boston, Oceanside Nightclub provides an unrivaled experience. Built in 1918, this old opera building now houses a massive 33,000 square foot space that can accommodate any unique occasion. Oceanside is certainly a venue unlike any other, blending the room's inherent intrinsic beauty with state-of-the-art sound and lighting enhancements.\n\nOceanside is a fully functional entertainment complex that can be transformed from a nightclub environment to a full concert hall as well as a corporate conference space. Simple layout tweaks can be used to make the area smaller, or the modular furniture can be removed entirely for large parties or sit-down presentations.\n\nFor any event, Oceanside offers one of the largest indoor LED walls in the New England area. It's a 10mm LED wall that is 9 feet tall by 16 feet wide and can accommodate any content you have for your event. In addition, we have four HD displays upon arrival, two in the lower lobby and three in the upper lobby, providing ample branding options for your event.\n\nOceanside features a full concert D&B Q10 line array system for sound, which can accommodate any audio requirement. No detail will be missed with a full-time production manager assigned to your event.\n\nWith the potential to combine two of our other locations in the same building, our special event staff can host gatherings of 50 to over 2,000 people. Product launches, fashion displays, charity fundraisers, sales meetings, commercial & video shoots, cocktail receptions, annual meetings, corporate promotions, and, of course, holiday events all work well at the beach.",

And, like you, we understand the importance of a nice dinner shared with friends. MIDA. It literally means \"he gives me.\" And each meal we prepare is intended to be a unique present for you.\n\nWe hope to see you in the near future.\n\nWe would be delighted to be a part of your event or special occasion, and would be delighted to reserve a piece of the restaurant or offer meals for your in-home or business gathering. Please be aware that neither of our MIDA locations has a private dining room. To make a request, please use the form found in the private events page of our website, or send any enquiries to events@midaboston.com. We can’t wait to be a part of your event!\n\nPatio reservations are only available on the same day. Request terrace seating the day of your reservation by calling the restaurant. Due to our limited capacity and to ensure the safest atmosphere possible, we kindly request that customers respect a 90-minute meal period.\n\n“We decided to come for our Anniversary dinner it was not only the best food we've ever had but the staff and chef made us feel like family. YOU MUST EAT HERE!!!” -Sarah R.\n\n“To say that we loved MIDA might be an understatement. From the food, to the service, and everything in between, MIDA made it worth it to travel into Boston on a Monday night in the middle of a boiling hot summer’s day for dinner… Just take our money. We can’t wait to go back.” -Katy N.",

B&G Oysters has won numerous awards for its food and wine program throughout the years.\n\nB&G Oysters offers a contemporary setting for a casual cocktail reception or sit-down dinner for your next private or corporate event, and our exclusive, stone-walled patio offers one of the greatest outdoor eating settings in the city from May to September.\n\nUp to 32 guests can be accommodated at separate tables in the dining area, with an extra 14 seats available at the bar. The dining area can hold a maximum of 50 people for a standing function.

In the event of inclement weather, the event will be rescheduled at a mutually convenient time and day.\n\nOur Wine Team has prepared a list of over 70 wines that match nicely with bivalves and the seasonal seafood meals served at B&G Oysters, inspired by their hunt for the most appropriate wines to enjoy with oysters. Each carefully selected wine demonstrates authenticity, seasonality, and history, as well as terroir, or \"feeling of place\" - the idea that wines are a natural match with the ingredients and cuisine of their original areas. Crisp, mineraly whites and a careful selection of ocean friendly reds from our favorite artisanal producers, in addition to Champagne, Chablis, and Muscadet – our favorite matches with oysters — round out our wine selections.\n\nWe are excited to welcome you!",

    "description": "The Union Oyster House, near Faneuil Hall on the Freedom Trail, holds the distinction of being America's oldest eatery. This Boston institution, housed in a pre-Revolutionary War building, began serving food in 1826 and has remained in the same location ever since, with the stalls and oyster bar, where Daniel Webster was a regular client, in their original locations.\n\nCocktail parties, buffets, and banquets can all be held in one of our private function spaces.\n\nOur Private Function Rooms and Private Dining Rooms are available for your next event, banquet, meeting, or party. We can accommodate parties between 20 and 100 persons.\n\nIt is our goal to make your next gathering a memorable and pleasurable occasion. Our knowledgeable staff is always ready to assist you in arranging your next event.\n\nIf you have a group of 20 or more persons, please contact our Dining Room Manager at (617) 227-2750.\n\nAlthough Union Street was laid out in 1636, two years after the Boston Common, there are no municipal documents indicating when the Oyster House was built. All that is known is that the structure has stood on Union Street for almost 250 years as a notable neighborhood landmark. The building hosted importer Hopestill Capen's fancy garment goods shop, \"At the Sign of the Cornfields,\" in 1742, before becoming a seafood house. The Boston shoreline had come up to the back door of the dry goods store at this time, making it easy for ships to deliver their cloth and products from Europe. The Union Oyster House has only had three owners since 1826. Mr. Joseph A. Milano, Jr., and Ms. Mary Ann Milano Picardi have been carrying on renowned dining and service traditions since 1970.",

It's a fully raw space that's been transformed into everything from a Broadway-style stage for the Huntington Theatre Company Gala to a one-of-a-kind retail pop-up for Nike with the help of brilliant merchants. The Cyclorama is a blank canvas on which you can paint whatever you want. Guests can also take advantage of the Boston Center for the Arts' aesthetic surrounds, which include murals and dramatic spaces that give flair and drama to events of all kinds.\n\nThe Stanford Calderwood Pavilion at Boston Center for the Arts, a collaboration between BCA and the Huntington Theatre Company, contributes to Boston's South End's status as a major cultural center. It's a three-story, 35, 000-square-foot building with two first-class theatres and three versatile event and rehearsal areas.\nThe Huntington Theatrical Company, SpeakEasy Stage Company, and Company One Theatre are among the award-winning and respected theatre organizations that have performed at the Calderwood Pavilion since its inception in 2004. Nearly one million people have visited the Calderwood Pavilion, which has hosted 4000 performances and more than 300 organizations.\n\nBoston Center for the Arts, which first opened its doors to the public in 1970, has been engaging the creative community for the public good for the past five decades. While the organization's physical home is in Boston's historic South End, the Boston Center for the Arts is involved in every aspect of the city's cultural environment. We provide the globe groundbreaking contemporary art exhibitions, award-winning theatre and dance performances, and arts experiences that defy categorization every year.",

Our approach to private events is one that emphasizes ease of organizing while maintaining a high level of elegance and detail. We will assist you in every part of your event to provide a stress-free, unforgettable experience, whether it is a high-profile corporate dinner, a special family celebration, or a wedding reception. Mistral offers a diverse menu, vast wine lists, and the ability to tailor your event to your specific needs. We recommend contacting Le Salon du Mistral early to secure availability for lunch and supper events, as well as Sunday brunch.\n\nChef Jamie Mammano's most ambitious culinary venture, Mistral, was destined to become a Boston dining legend from the moment it opened its doors in 1997. Jamie earned a reputation as one of the country's most highly regarded chefs during stints at The Jockey Club and Le Pavillion Restaurant in Washington DC, as the chef for the United States Ambassador to Spain, and ten years spent in the kitchens of the Four Seasons Hotel Company in Washington DC, Seattle, Chicago, and Boston. Jamie single-handedly drove the Four Seasons Hotel Boston's dining room, Aujourd'hui, to the top of the Zagat Survey of Boston Restaurants in 1995 while acting as Executive Chef. Soon after, Boston Magazine readers voted Aujourd'hui as Boston's best restaurant, while Condé Nast Traveler named it the country's best restaurant.",

    "description": "Chef Chris Coombs and restaurateur Brian Piccini created Deuxave to deliver Modern French cuisine made with the freshest American ingredients obtained from the greatest local farmers, fishermen, and foragers.\n\nDeuxave, located on the renowned crossroads of Commonwealth and Massachusetts Avenues, offers a fully modern dining experience complete with superb service, an exquisite dining room, and a world-class wine selection.\n\nDeuxave's team is excited to host your huge parties and private gatherings. We're excited to announce that we're now taking reservations for groups of seven or more. Chef Chris Coombs will provide an unforgettable meal for you and your friends. We provide an a la carte dinner menu, a curated \"selected\" three-course menu, and a seasonal five-course tasting menu where you may put yourself totally in Chef's hands. Our sommelier can recommend additional wine pairings to best match each dish.\n\nDining in Semi-Private Alcoves can accommodate groups of 7 to 12 people. They're ideal for a business meal or a get-together with friends and family.\n\nThe Main Dining Room can accommodate groups of up to 20 people. A partial or full buyout may be required if there are more than 20 guests.\n\nThe Bar & Lounge can accommodate groups of up to 16 people.\n\nThe Main Patio can accommodate gatherings of up to 24 people.\n\nThe Terrace can accommodate groups of up to 40 people.\n\nFull and partial buyouts are available for bigger groups.\n\nThere's a mode for every emotion when it comes to French food in this town, whether you want a bistro-standard croque-monsieur or a carefully presented, multicourse extravaganza. Christopher Coombs, the wunderkind chef at Deuxave, cherry-picks from both traditions, masterfully blending what might seem like opposing impulses—hearty (upgraded) French onion soup; the swoosh-heavy, haute-cuisine-styled \"Duo of Pork & First of the Season Apricots\" —into an unlikely menu.",

    "description": "We work with youth, ages 16-24, who are in the foster care system, court-involved, homeless, out of school, parenting, or involved with the Department of Mental Health. At More Than Words, our young people earn a spot on our team running a successful $4M business, gain promotions, set and achieve personal goals, advocate for their rights, and learn skills to set them up for success in any career path they choose.\n\nBecause too often our young people are treated for their problems rather than engaged as part of their own solution. In our work-based social enterprise, youth experience a real job and all that comes with it: a paycheck, a sense of mattering when a team relies on them, feedback and performance reviews, promotions and leadership.\n\nMore Than Words started as the \"book people\" and we still are - but we are so much more. Our social enterprises are the vehicle for youth transformation and as we've grown we've innovated with new vehicles and new ways to connect with our community.",

For private events, festivities, weddings, and other events can be held privately and in an intimate setting. 1928 Beacon Hill is the ideal location for hosting small-scale public or private events, including weddings and festivities. We have a full bar and serve dinner. Our menu focuses on traditional American cuisine, and the atmosphere of the restaurant pays homage to Jenkins's experience in antiques.\n\nThe design of 1928 Beacon Hill is composed of three distinct elements in terms of aesthetics: Throughout the years, Jenkins has amassed a collection of antique paintings and wall mounts from the Black Forest, and this collection is on display in the bar and lounge area of the establishment. The room at the back exudes an air of a dark club room with its leather banquettes and seductive lighting, while the section in the middle is decorated in a nautical theme with oars and artwork that focuses on the sea. There are seating options for around 90 diners over the entirety of the restaurant, including 14 at the bar.\n\nThe proprietor's grandfather was the person who first inspired the owner's interest in the restaurant business, and the restaurant can be seen as a form of monument to the grandfather. In addition to the atmosphere of the restaurant being reminiscent of the 1920s, Jenkins explained that the name of the establishment is a reference to the year that her grandfather was born.",

    "description": "At Legal Sea Foods, you can celebrate a special occasion or hold a corporate function. We personalize every meal item and finishing touch. Our private dining room, which has a flat screen television, can accommodate up to 32 guests for a seated occasion and up to 35 guests for a cocktail reception. If the weather permits, our outside deck overlooking Hammond Pond provides a picturesque setting for up to 50 guests. Legal Sea Foods' private dining offers excellent food, service, and convenience. For more information, please contact our special events manager. If you have unique demands, budget concerns, or are arranging several parties, our Private Events concierge team is happy to assist you.\n\nThe Berkowitz family opened a fish market in Cambridge's Inman Square neighborhood in 1950, giving birth to the Legal Sea Foods brand. Customers were granted \"Legal Stamps\" (forerunners of S&H green stamps) with their purchases at a related family business adjacent to the market at the time, a grocery store called Legal Cash Market. The name \"Legal\" became linked with excellence and freshness throughout this time.\n\nThe first Legal Sea Foods restaurant debuted in 1968, directly across from the fish market. The fish was simply grilled or cooked before being distributed on paper plates at communal picnic tables.\n\nThe Company's commitment to quality standards, freshness, and the integrity of the entire pier-to-plate process remains unchanged today. By concentrating on people (our employees and guests) and excellence in everything we do, we continue to raise the bar and set the brand apart from the competition. So when we declare, \"If it isn't fresh, it isn't Legal!\" we're reaffirming a dedication that has kept the brand alive for more than 50 years.",

    "description": "Make your next private gathering one to remember. For gatherings of all sizes and events, Porto provides a range of private and semi-private locations. We’ve got four lovely spaces that you can make your own for your next event.\n\nChef Jody Adams, a James Beard Award winner, closed her Harvard Square restaurant Rialto in 2016 after a remarkable 22-year tenure. Great food, in her opinion, no longer required a nice dining setting. She shifted her focus to the Boston eateries she co-founded with Eric Papachristos, Sean Griffing, and Jon Mendez.\n\nTRADE, a bustling restaurant on the Greenway in the financial area, has been shaking since 2011. And since its opening day in 2015, Saloniki, a fast-casual Greek restaurant in the Fenway, has had lines snaking out the door; its Cambridge branch, which is only a year old, is as popular. Finally, guests seeking a taste of Adams' famous Mediterranean meals without the white-tablecloth formality can visit Porto, a full-service restaurant next to Sak's Fifth Avenue that debuted a few months before Rialto shuttered.\n\nAdams says, \"I never stand still.\"\n\nAdams is most proud of her work campaigning for children's welfare or combating hunger through her support of the Boston Food Bank, despite having a closet full of \"best\" trophies for her food and restaurants. Share our Strength honored her with the Humanitarian of the Year Award in 2010. She helps create and maintain the hospitality programs for Partners in Health institutions during her regular visits to Haiti. Adams may be at the top of her career right now, but another pinnacle might be right around the corner. In the fall of next year, a third Saloniki will debut in Harvard Square. She isn't standing still at all. In May of 2018, Adams will be admitted into the esteemed James Beard Foundation's \"Who's Who\" list.",

    "description": "We discussed the possibility of changing one of our three pillars, \"Food,\" to \"Cooking\" in a meeting with our graphic designer. The goal was to make a more aesthetically and auditorily unified term, but this proposed adjustment couldn't reflect the core and scope of \"Food\" Because our concept extends much beyond cooking. \"Food\" encapsulates the warmth, humor, and love shared with family and friends over a meal. When you take the first mouthful of a new dish or ingredient, you get a flutter of excitement in your stomach. Food is the medium through which we share tales and cultivate new friendships.\n\nThe richness and flavor that we feel through sensory explosion is due to the farmer who devotes his or her days and nights to tending to crops and cattle. The scientist is the one who comes up with new strategies to keep agricultural practices sustainable and impactful. The mother and father are the ones who work numerous jobs to provide a dinner for their family.\n\nTo put it another way, \"food\" is more than just something we eat.\n\nSo, what exactly is PAGU? There are intangible qualities of PAGU that, like \"Food,\" cannot be expressed eloquently or accurately in words. It's not just a restaurant. It's more than a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. PAGU, like our playful and tenacious pug buddy Phoebe, is a dynamic and transforming spirit that encourages our friends and guests to live life to the fullest, both literally and metaphorically. We want to celebrate family, friends, innovation, and creativity, among other things, via food and service. We challenge ourselves to make feel-good homey food that talks to the body and spirit, inspired by our local excursions and trips across the world — something that consistently called to us no matter where we were, regardless of the cuisine.\n\nPAGU will work with you to arrange every detail of your rehearsal dinner, wedding reception, or ceremony, from the cuisine to the cocktails, space design, hotel accommodations, and everything in between.",

Carrie Nation has a long history of designing and throwing parties, and our track record speaks for itself. See what we can do to assist you with your upcoming big event.\n\nRagtime and jazz pipe through the speakers into three classy yet comfortable dining places as diverse in décor as they are in their titles, which are located on Beacon Hill, just a stone's throw from the State House. Learn about Carrie Nation's outlandish efforts to rid America of alcohol while smugly indulging in a variety of era-inspired cocktails.\n\nYou can choose from a wide range of meal options at Carrie Nation Restaurant and Cocktail Club, all of which are designed to suit the environment and a precisely poured cocktail. Even if the main eating areas are attractive and appealing, sneak through the bar to a passage immediately beyond it, make your way to the red velvet curtain, and prepare to be plundered. You'll need a twenty spot, a secret handshake, or a password to get into Boston's Original Speakeasy. The Speakeasy, an attractive, windowless lounge with soft leather seats, dark polished wood, billiards, and a full bar, is a comfortable and sassy setting for residents and tourists alike, deserving of its famous hatchet wielding notice.",

    "description": "Let the Castle be the beautiful backdrop that your next event needs! From weddings to corporate events, the spacious interior is ideal for large events. Work with our list of vendors and accommodating staff to make your next occasion perfect.\n\nIn addition to being a special event location, the Saunders Castle at Park Plaza is also a meeting, conference, and trade show site. Ideally situated in Boston's Back Bay on Columbus Avenue and Arlington Street, in one of the city's more historic areas while also being close to the city's main hotels and convention centers, the Castle is a must-see.\n\nIts 14,642 square feet of event space makes it a vast and versatile location, making it ideal for a wide range of events such as special events, meetings, exhibits, galas, product launches, receptions, social gatherings, and tradeshows, among others.\n\nCombined with the existing dimmable lighting above, the space has an open sense thanks to the high ceiling height. Throughout the space, there are numerous rigging locations for hanging truss and lights, as well as audio and décor. The use of brick and wrought iron details throughout the venue contributes to the historic appearance and feel of the space while also serving as a blank canvas for future design and branding initiatives.\n\nThe First Corps of Cadets, a Massachusetts military group that was founded in 1741, was responsible for the design, construction, and financing of the Armory. As the sole existing High Victorian armory in the city of Boston, the Armory is a National Historic Landmark and has been listed as such. Throughout the years, the Castle has played host to some of the most exclusive events in Boston.",

    "description": "The beautiful ballroom, perched atop Strawberry Hill, has enormous windows overlooking our championship golf course and a panoramic view of the Boston cityscape. We'd be delighted to help you plan a memorable occasion!\n\nWith the value and simplicity of a wedding package plan, the Oakley Country Club, which was founded in 1898, continues its long reputation of great food and service. For retirement parties, employee appreciation dinners, fundraisers, and holiday parties, we are glad to offer a range of menu selections. Showers, baptisms, reunions, and birthday parties are all held in the ballroom. Contact us immediately to start planning your 50-300 person special event.\n\nThe ballroom at Oakley Country Club can accommodate up to 205 guests and boasts the coveted middle-of-the-room dance floor, giving all of your guests a perfect view of your special day. The appropriate place to start your event is in a separate cocktail area with a view of the Boston skyline and our beautiful golf course.\n\nIn a devastating fire in 1962, the old Oakley Clubhouse was destroyed. It was replaced by a new clubhouse, which was rebuilt in 1998 to match the original Bulfinch building's lines. The Club's efforts to maintain the charm of a New England rural estate while delivering best-in-class country club accommodations are being bolstered by the 2018-19 clubhouse renovations. The configuration of the course has remained unchanged since the last Ross re-design in 1910. In 2004, the Club hired restoration architects to look over the century-old Ross plans and realign the bunkers and greens to match the Master's layout. Oakley is a landlocked city club. Because our architect's greatest talent was his ability to route fairways, our 85 precious acres allow us an extraordinarily efficient 6,000 yard course!",

    "description": "One of life's many pleasures, we feel, is sharing exceptional meals with your favorite people. Tuesday through Sunday, Fat Hen offers a wonderful private and semi-private dining event area. The restaurant's total capacity is 30 people sitting and 50 people standing.\n\nFat Hen, La Brasa's younger sister, is a modest fifteen-table, thirty-seat restaurant specializing in modern Italian tasting menus. From the moment you come through the door until the last mouthful, our team is focused on the guest experience and making memories. Our passion for good wines, thorough preparation, impeccable technique, and high-quality local products is reflected in our seasonal menus, which change frequently. Please join us as we unveil our new wine bar concept with small paired nibbles. For any new menu updates, please follow us on social media @fathenboston.\n\nSeasonal Italian cuisine served in a small, book-lined room with a mysterious cocktail window.\nFat Hen, which is housed in the former La Brasa marketplace location, serves pasta with seasonal stuffings and toppings, as well as secondi meals such roasted duck breast and wood-grilled strip steak. The little cocktail window, where drinks are delivered through from the La Brasa bar, only adds to the pleasures of the super-cozy room.\n\nHomemade pasta is served in this cozy, pleasant eatery.\nThis is a slam dunk for romance. Plus, the more committed a restaurant is to seasonal ingredients, the better. (There's nothing more enticing than localism!) The Fat Hen ticks all the boxes: a modest, book-lined space, regionally inspired pastas, and indulgent dishes like roasted duck breast. Your date will be enthralled by the time your drinks arrive through the cocktail window leading to sibling restaurant La Brasa.",

    "description": "Colin and Heather Lynch, together with partner Jefferson Macklin, open Bar Mezzana, their first restaurant, in Boston's South End district. The team's energetic journey brings the simplicity and elegance of coastal Italian cooking to a modern, colorful environment at 360 Harrison Avenue, after more than 30 years of operating Barbara Lynch's internationally acclaimed restaurants. Genuine, warm service and hospitality are underlined by Aperol spritzes, an award-winning Crudo cuisine, and a career immersed in pasta creation.\n\nBar Mezzana's wine program, led by Heather Lynch and Beverage Director Ryan Lotz, has a carefully chosen range of varietals to complement Chef Lynch's cuisine, including both well-known bottles and lesser-known (but equally excellent) finds. The cocktail menu has a similar chemistry with the meals. The list contains the perfect Negroni, the perfect Spritz, a handful of seasonal drinks, and a selection of Amari, all of which are heavily influenced by the seasons and traditional Italian cocktails.\n\nColin is a native New Englander who grew up in Newburyport, Massachusetts and attended the Culinary Institute of America for his Bachelor's Degree in Professional Studies before settling in Boston. He had an internship at Chef Barbara Lynch's flagship restaurant No. 9 Park while at the CIA and returned to work with Barbara after graduation. Chef Barbara Lynch got the James Beard Award for \"Best Chef Northeast\" in 2003 while he was on the team. After that, starting in 2004, Colin was appointed to Chef de Cuisine at No. 9 Park. Colin assisted Chef Barbara Lynch in developing menus and staff when she expanded to the South End with B&G Oysters and The Butcher Shop.\n\nColin's efforts during the opening of Menton resulted in the restaurant receiving Boston's first Relais & Chateaux designation, being nominated for \"Best New Restaurant\" by the James Beard Foundation in 2011, being named one of the best new restaurants in the country by Esquire, and receiving The Boston Globe's first four-star review from food editor Devra First.\n\nColin and his wife Heather Lynch, as well as former Gruppo colleague Jefferson Macklin, started their own restaurant in June 2016. The creative crudo, handmade pastas, and welcoming hospitality at Bar Mezzana in Boston's South End have won rave reviews from local press and guests.",

    "description": "At Ostra, our private space easily seats 42 guests for luncheons or dinners, and 70 people for a cocktail event. Smaller cocktail receptions can be held in the Lounge, while larger gatherings of up to 150 people can be accommodated in our main Dining Room.\n\nChef/Owner Jamie Mammano and Executive Chef Mitchell Randall have devised a Mediterranean menu that emphasizes the quality and tastes of the seafood via simple, clean presentations. Our private dining menu, which features the finest seafood available, includes a choice of local and Mediterranean seafood alternatives, as well as beef and poultry selections to meet the needs of all guests.\n\nOstra is a contemporary Mediterranean restaurant in Boston's Back Bay, located at One Charles Street South. Chef/Owner Jamie Mammano and Executive Chef Mitchell Randall focus on specialty seafood found throughout the Mediterranean and places within the United States, and are inspired by local and European variations of seafood. Our cuisine's mild preparation brings out the natural and fresh flavors of each dish. In a pleasant and friendly setting, Ostra's dining room inspires a feeling of flair and sophistication. A beautiful bar and lounge area with live piano entertainment are also available at Ostra.\n\nExecutive Chef Mitchell Randall developed an interest in the culinary arts while helping his mother in the kitchen of his Scarborough, Maine home as a child. Chef Randall began working as a line cook and dishwasher at the age of 14, quickly understanding that his ultimate professional objective was to be an Executive Chef.\n\nThe core abilities were learned at an early age, resulting in a distinct culinary foundation that was formalized at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island. Chef Randall became the Columbus Hospitality Group's youngest Executive Chef at the age of 25. In October 2013, Chef Randall departed Mistral to start Ostra Restaurant with Chef Jamie Mammano. Chef Randall, who grew up near the sea, was ecstatic to embark on this new culinary adventure. Chef Randall's delicate preparation of seafood showcases the natural and fresh tastes of each dish, showcasing the best seafood available locally and abroad. Chef Randall believes that the most important aspect of running a successful kitchen is to constantly improve himself and his team. He leads by example in the kitchen and encourages his employees to work hard. Chef Randall's visionary approach, along with unrivaled expertise and training, has allowed him to constantly create award-winning cuisine.",

    "description": "Thank you for considering having your wedding ceremony at King's Chapel!\n\nSince the Reverend Robert Ratcliffe celebrated New England's first wedding here on May 18, 1686, only three days after his arrival in Boston, King's Chapel has hosted hundreds of weddings. Friends and family will be able to watch you exchanging vows and taking another step along life's journey together in our historic sanctuary, which was erected in 1754.\n\nWe provide a more intimate setting in The Little Chapel at our Parish House, a beautiful townhouse with its own charm at 64 Beacon Street, for weddings with less than 50 guests.\n\nOur wedding service is based on Anglican tradition and is available in our Prayerbook. It is a traditional ceremony during which the pair exchanges vows and rings as a symbol of their commitment. Friends and relatives are asked if they will stand with you and support you while you keep each other safe. The event closes with a blessing, with everyone invested in the union. We welcome you to attend our 11 a.m. Sunday services to become acquainted with our liturgy and the church.\n\nWe marry couples of any faith or sexual orientation in the inclusive spirit of the One we adore, in keeping with our welcoming of all.\n\nPlease contact Gretchen Horton, Parish Administrator, if you have any questions regarding holding a wedding at King's Chapel.\n\nWe take our application process very seriously because we believe that marriage is a choice that requires love, support, and community to be happy. Couples who marry at King's Chapel get to know our clergy and begin dialogues about their relationships that (hopefully) will help them through difficult times as a pair in the future.",

    "description": "Yvonne's redefines the Supper Club dining experience with an amazing seasonal menu and a beautifully constructed environment, making it the ideal place to hold your gathering for any occasion. We provide a variety of personalized choices, ranging from a small gathering to a fully exclusive event.\n\nThe new Yvonne's area beneath the Library offers a very exclusive and intimate eating experience, as well as amusing pop cultural references that provide commentary on modern life. The Gallery has only seven tables, therefore bookings are exceedingly limited and only accessible by special request. The entry is hidden behind a secret bookcase in the back of the Library Lounge, hidden from Yvonne's raucous main floor.\n\nThe Supper Club harkens back to a time when comfort and attention to detail took precedence above fashion. The area has a weathered backdrop and polished furnishings. Antique crystal chandeliers, tufted heather gray sofas, clean white linen-draped tables, and hand-clipped Calacatta marble floors. Locke- Ober's original Santo Domingo mahogany bar, meticulously hand-carved on-site by French woodworkers in 1886, is the focal point of the dining area. The Supper Club is a great place for seated group eating, business events, and birthday parties.\n\nYvonne's lounge, which is adjacent to the dining room, similarly strips down a once-ornate room to its unpainted brick walls and tin ceiling coffers for informal business gatherings and joyous cocktail parties.\n\nStyled bookcases, fine dining tables, herringbone wood floors, a hand-cut mahogany bar, and Locke- Ober's original gilded fireplace are all found in the Library. Charmaine Olivia's edgy, ethereal representations of famous historical characters hang among the Library's multi-hued books, creating a vibrant depiction of Yvonne's polished, yet fiery personality. The Library is imposing and an excellent choice for any type of event.",

    "description": "What happens around the dinner table, we believe, is one of the greatest sources of delight. Let us create the right private event for you, whether you're hosting a small gathering or a large gathering, a casual reception or a formal dinner. Lunches, dinners, cocktail receptions, taster tours, wine tastings, and demos are all available. Below are some of our space options.\n\nIn our third-floor dining room, which is focused on an open kitchen and a massive wood-burning grill, you can host your gathering. Your guests will be transported to an Italian greenhouse as they sip seasonal beverages and relax as the Terra culinary team prepares a menu of perfectly balanced smoke-kissed dishes using seasonal ingredients, all while being surrounded by greenery. The Terra culinary staff cooks seasonal fresh foods over flaming flames in the dining room, enabling the simple flavors to emerge. The herb-infused drinks, extensive wines, and local brews complement the earthy cuisine nicely. In other words, each visit to Terra will provide you with a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nThe casual, busy restaurant serves groups of 12 to 25 people and focuses on the culinary mainstays of Italian cuisine. Your visitors will be able to enjoy Italian beverages while watching professional chefs and pizza makers prepare food right in front of their eyes. While pizza and pasta are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Italian cuisine, there is a reason why these two culinary classics are Italy's most popular exports. Just feet away from where our professional pasta cooks and dough-slinging pizzaioli (pizza makers) create dishes, you may enjoy our seasonal assortment.",

We hope to host your next event!\n\nA Baja-inspired restaurant featuring a menu that showcases chef Jason Santos' passion for Southern California and Mexican coastal cuisine. Cocktails and décor inspired by the seaside. Tequila and mezcal in a wide range of flavors.\n\nChef Jason splits his time between Buttermilk & Bourbon, a New Orleans-inspired restaurant with as much character and charm as the city itself, and Citrus & Salt, a Back Bay-based coastal Mexican restaurant. B & B Fish in Marblehead, Jason's newest restaurant, serves coastal New England summertime favorites with Jason's trademark twists.\n\nSantos has also been on the Today Show, CBS Early Show, CBS television show The Talk, and Hell's Kitchen in following seasons.

Jason may also be seen on Fox's hit show Hell's Kitchen this winter/spring as Chef Gordon Ramsay's Blue Team's sous chef.\n\nSantos released his first cookbook, Buttermilk & Bourbon, in March of this year, which is available in bookstores and on Amazon.\n\n“I loved our experience at Citrus and Salt. The drinks were amazing (I LOVED the Smoke Show as well as the Devils Sweat) and the food was exceptional... We also loved our server who was super attentive and kind. She never seemed rushed or stressed, even when it got busy. Everything was fresh, timely, and delicious. We will be back!” - Julie P.",

    "description": "Artu was established on the most basic Italian technique: wonderful ingredients served simply.\n\nArtu first opened its doors to the world in February 1992, with exceptional sandwiches and mouthwatering roasted meats. Since then, we have continued to improve and grow. We've steadily expanded our repertoire since then. We've created old-world comfort food dishes from those sandwiches and roasted meats, as well as modern versions of those classics that make even the most discerning diner remember about their upbringing.\n\nSome may recall our kitchen being hidden behind a high counter that was visible from the dining room. A magnificent granite bar now stands in its stead, serving delectable libations till 2 a.m. A tiny dining area perches above the bar, with views of both the bar and Prince Street. It's ideal for any customer as a private dining area or lounge. The main dining room is large enough to accommodate any size group, and it is noted for its lively atmosphere. Artu has become a go-to for tourists and our North End neighbors alike since those February days in 1992.\n\nDo you want Artu to host your next party or event? Simply phone us at 617-742-4336 or fill out the form on the events page of our website, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible!\n\n“Decided to try this place at the recommendation of our Uber driver and it definitely didn’t disappoint! Probably the best meal I’ve ever had. Service was wonderful-the servers made you feel right at home!” -Stephanie C.",

Their social distancing is on point but you hardly even notice, that's how enjoyable it is. This is hands down has and will always be the hottest spot in the bean. We came in on Friday to celebrate an anniversary. The food was so tasty and awesome but the service was even better and made all the difference. Nancy was super fun and so cool she made us felt like top priority but not overbearing. We never had to ask for a thing. She's a mind reader. The drinks are incredible. If you want to impress your party or that special one, come in here. Ask about Nancy. It's Monday and we're still talking about Empire. Highly recommend.” -Anna D.",

The structure, which is on the National Register of Historic Places, was conceived in 1814 by renowned architect Charles Bulfinch, erected in 1889, and refurbished in 1985 as a performing arts center by architect Graham Gund.\n\nOur theater can accommodate 150 people for a seated meal with room for a small dance floor area, or 200 people for a standing reception, depending on your needs and general set-up. Our Gallery has seating for 40-50 people.\n\nOnly our venue is included in our rental packages. Please visit Additional Rental Items for chair and table rentals. We do not provide linens, dishware, cocktail tables, decorations, or flowers, thus these items must be arranged through an outside vendor.\n\nWe promote diversity through the events we provide in the visual and performing arts. We make our space available to artists and groups who might not otherwise have access to a professionally equipped and accessible facility or the cultural mainstream because we are a multi-use art center.\n\n\"Very affordable, super elegant without being over the top, beautiful building and grounds, really friendly and accommodating staff...we couldn't have been happier with the place we picked for our big day, it was perfect!\" - C﻿.K.",

    "description": "Our virtual and in-person dumpling workshops are a unique way to bring your team together, whether you're celebrating a product launch or searching for a novel team-building activity. Continue reading to learn more about our in-person, virtual, and instruction-only options.\n\nWe are a farm-focused, woman-owned dumpling company that seeks to be a good company in all ways. That's why we carefully select our components and prioritize our community in everything we do.\n\nChef Irene Li and her two older siblings started Mei Mei as a food truck in 2012. Mei Mei food is a reflection of the Li siblings' best childhood dining memories as Chinese-American youngsters growing up in Boston. \"Mei Mei\" means \"little sister\" in Mandarin Chinese.\n\nMei Mei's unique dumpling combinations reflect our passion for wonderful New England ingredients and a desire to create delicious dishes. We work with small, independent family farms in the Northeast to acquire pasture-raised meat. Throughout the year, we may get 70 percent of our food from the Northeast. Mei Mei has been a \"Open Book\" firm since 2018, which means they disclose all financial information with all employees, empowering them to think and act like managers regardless of their position or title.\n\nThe business has altered since the pandemic. Our food truck has been taken off the road, and our restaurant dining room has been closed. But Mei Mei isn't going anywhere; in fact, our dumplings are making their way all over the world! Mei Mei dumplings are now available at farmers' markets in Wayland, Natick, Melrose, Roslindale, Belmont, Cambridge, Somerville, and elsewhere in the Greater Boston area.",

Our distinctive setting gently transports you to the Mediterranean with ease and pleasure, and trade has been fully redesigned.\n\nTrade is the location to organize your events in Boston, MA, with a new refurbishment, a new concept, and a space ready for anything. Not only will guests be transported to the Mediterranean with ease and luxury, but they will also enjoy exquisite meals and creative beverages.\n\nPlease complete the form below and we will contact you as soon as possible.\n\nWe had a very basic and effective approach when Trade first opened its doors in 2011 — fantastic atmosphere, great service, and great food.\n\nTrade provides a refreshing break from ordinary living. Trade is where experiences flow, inspired by the deepest ideals of Greek and Mediterranean ways of life, discussion, plate sharing, and relationship-building.\n\nWe've had a very basic and effective strategy since opening our doors in 2011: excellent atmosphere, amazing service, and great food. We have deep origins in Greece and the Mediterranean, and we revere its cuisine and culture. The interchange of hospitality, food, ideas, and memories is at the heart of trade. To learn more, click the link below!\n\nChef Jody Adams says that working with people, working with food, and developing a community are her top objectives, and she lives up to them every day. Jody's values and passions have guided her long career in the kitchen, her charity work, and her involvement in local and international communities. Jody earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology from Brown University, but a serendipitous meeting with Julia Child and Sara Moulton led her to Lydia Shire at Seasons, where she worked for four years on the line and then three years as sous chef for Gordon Hamersley at Hamersley's Bistro. Her second job was as an executive chef at Michela's, where she worked under Michela Larson. These experiences prepared her for the opening of Rialto, which she ran for 22 years before shutting in 2016.",

    "description": "We would like to invite you to join us in hosting it. The Hourly Oyster House can accommodate groups of all sizes for cocktail parties, reunions, corporate recruiting events, and other gatherings, and can satisfy a variety of budgetary requirements. An inviting neighborhood outpost in the heart of Harvard Square, The Hourly Oyster House serves thoughtfully sourced and playful prepared seafood and oysters from New England and beyond. The bar offers an extensive selection of signature cocktails, beer and wine as well as a carefully curated selection of craft beers and wines. Dunster Street, which was originally known as Water Street in Colonial times because of its proximity to the old banks of the Charles River, was once the meeting point for the horse-drawn wagons, known as \"Hourlies,\" that left Cambridge each day – on the hour – for Boston. Dunster Street is now a residential neighborhood. This line, which was founded in 1826, was one of the first high-frequency transportation routes in North America and was one of the first in the world. The construction of the Harvard Square subway station marked not only a significant development in transportation, but it also laid the groundwork for future connections, collaboration and innovation between Harvard Square and Boston, and ultimately, the rest of the world. The history of the structure at 15 Dunster Street is just as rich and complex. The exact footprint on which The Hourly stands is believed to be the location where the first Freeman's Oath was printed in 1639. It is also the site of the original Second Cambridge Savings Bank building, as well as Herrell's, which has been a Harvard Square institution for 27 years and is a Harvard Square institution. When it comes to the Hourly, it pays homage to the square's colorful heritage while while providing a contemporary atmosphere and experience.",

    "description": "With us, you can celebrate a special occasion or host a corporate event. We personalize every meal item and finishing touch. In our semi-private lounge at Legal Crossing, we can accommodate 25 guests for a cocktail reception. A 75-person seated dinner and 80-person cocktail reception are possible with a partial buy-out. For larger parties, a full buy-out is offered for up to 125 people for seated events and 160 people for a cocktail reception. Legal Crossing's group dining offers excellent food, service, and convenience. For more information, please contact our special events manager.\n\nThe Berkowitz family opened a fish market in Cambridge's Inman Square neighborhood in 1950, giving birth to the Legal Sea Foods brand. Customers were granted \"Legal Stamps\" (forerunners of S&H green stamps) with their purchases at a related family business adjacent to the market at the time, a grocery store called Legal Cash Market. The name \"Legal\" became linked with excellence and freshness throughout this time.\n\nThe first Legal Sea Foods restaurant debuted in 1968, directly across from the fish market. The fish was simply grilled or cooked before being distributed on paper plates at communal picnic tables.\n\nThe Company's commitment to quality standards, freshness, and the integrity of the entire pier-to-plate process remains unchanged today. By concentrating on people (our employees and guests) and excellence in everything we do, we continue to raise the bar and set the brand apart from the competition. So when we declare, \"If it isn't fresh, it isn't Legal!\" we're reaffirming a dedication that has kept the brand alive for more than 50 years.",

    "description": "Coquette serves fresh seafood, a hot-and-cold raw bar, flatbreads, and upmarket libations in a relaxed ambiance inspired by the flavors of the Basque Country along the Spanish-French coastline.\n\nCoquette, which sits cross-legged and sipping a martini on the ground floor of the new Omni Boston Hotel at the Seaport, is right across the street from the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, so it'll be a popular spot for visiting professionals to meet for a nightcap before retiring to a room upstairs.\n\nCoquette is also the newest addition to COJE Management Group's growing portfolio, which includes Yvonne's, Mariel, Ruka, and Lolita, among other popular, vampy locations for fashionable dining, drinking, and socializing in Boston. Expect Coquette's lovely decor and delectable menu, which features twists on coastal French cuisine, to draw a large number of residents seeking for love at first sight and bite.\n\nInside the 240-seat restaurant, a delicate and beautiful pastel-leaning color scheme of blues, pinks, and lavender has been used. The walls have a slightly iridescent sheen that reminds me of the inside of a nicely formed oyster shell, and there are dried, preserved flowers displayed in seasonal, installation-like groupings developed by East Olivia of New York. Meanwhile, a soundproofed ceiling above the four-sided bar is covered in a replica of François Lemoyne's The Apotheosis of Hercules, a rococo ceiling painting at Versailles known for its beautiful detail (as well as the tortured genius of the artist, who fell on his own sword shortly after). The dining room mural, which is a reproduction of Art Nouveau icon Alphonse Mucha's The Seasons, a series of paintings of nymph-like females representing spring, summer, fall, and winter, has been given a modern aesthetic flourish.\n\nReach out to coordinate your private event today!",

    "description": "In 2020, Sarah Marshall opened Lucille with a simple mission: to bring restaurant-caliber hospitality and sommelier-level knowledge to a friendly, neighborhood wine shop. Visitors will find a broad selection of wines from old-world growers at all price points, plus some other fun surprises.\n\nSarah grew up learning how to cook with her mom. She continued that love of cooking (and cookbooks and wine) throughout college and beyond. After graduating, she landed a job at the legendary Boston restaurant, l’Espalier. There, Sarah learned to pair her homegrown senses of flavor and warmth with a refined appreciation of taste, hospitality, and finesse.\n\nHer education continued though other Boston food-and-wine destinations: Central Bottle, BRIX, The Butcher Shop, Stir, The Boston Harbor Hotel, and as Wine Director at Oleanna and Sarma. Sarah is a graduate of Boston University’s Elizabeth Bishop Wine Program, and is a certified sommelier through The Court of Master Sommeliers.\n\nLucille is named after Sarah’s maternal grandmother, whose life was about community, travel, and building a home away from home. Growing up in a military family meant being part of a big neighborhood, which meant cookouts with the entire block of the military base. Lucille relished her role as the community chef, and was always happiest when she was cooking. Soups, casseroles, cookies and pies, hamburgers and homemade French fries years before the fast food boom made them daily staples.\n\nIn her retirement, Lucille cooked for a fraternity at the University of Tennessee, and boy did she shine! She would tell stories to her daughter, Brenda, about the boys who called her “Mom.” She planned and cooked three meals for fifty boys seven days a week. That’s high math for a woman with only an 8th grade education. Lucille passed on her stories, recipes, and knowledge to Sarah’s mom, Brenda, who in turn gave Sarah her start as a food lover.",

    "description": "Once a colonial farmstead known as Cherry Hill Farm, the Bradley Estate was transformed in 1902 into a classic country estate. Dr. Arthur Tracey Cabot hired noted Architect Charles Platt to design a great house, landscaped grounds, and a complex of farm and estate buildings. Platt adorned the lovely natural setting with manicured lawns, a walled garden, and a brick-edged parterre garden.\n\nIn 1945, Cabot's niece Eleanor Cabot Bradley acquired Cherry Hill Farm and lived there with her husband until its bequest to The Trustees of Reservations in 1991. Mrs. Bradley made some notable additions to the property, including a greenhouse and a studio. Today, the Bradley Estate is open to the public and the house and grounds host special occasions for both private and corporate clients.",

    "description": "Originally designed in 1880, Moraine Farm has been hailed as \"the finest existing example of Frederick Law Olmsted's approach to planning a country estate\" by pre-eminent Olmsted scholar Charles E. Beveridge. Olmsted created lawns, hedges, rustic stone walls, and a magnificent meadow – and collaborated with Boston architects Peabody and Stearns to design a massive stone terrace facing the lake, extending the shingle-and-stone house into the landscape. The farm took its name from a low ridge of glacial debris, called a moraine, which Olmsted used to provide an elevated vantage point for the paths and carriage drives that looped through 75 acres of coniferous forest, passed lake and meadow views, and climbed to an overlook on the edge of the 40-acre farm.\n\nThe Estate at Moraine Farm is a spectacular setting for your wedding or special event. This historic property is set on 175 acres, much of which is conservation land and forest, and is sited overlooking beautiful Wenham Lake.",

    "description": "Welcome to a hidden gem in the heart of the North Shore—a pristine historical estate that sets the stage for your magical wedding day. Our enchanting mansion, steeped in a century of history, offers timeless elegance and unparalleled privacy for your special moments.\n\nAs of January 1st, 2024, The Mansion at the Hellenic Center has undergone a change in management, marking the beginning of a new chapter for us! We are now proudly known as Floriana. Our decision to embrace this new name is rooted in the rich history of our 100-year-old Georgian-style mansion. The estate was named Floriana by its original owner, Anna Pingree Peabody in 1903, and this change symbolizes the deep connection we have with the property’s storied past.\n\nFloriana is ideally suited for groups of 80-140 guests during the months of November to April. Additionally, our Tidewater Sailcloth tent offers a perfect space for larger gatherings, accommodating groups from 125-200 guests from May to October.\n\nApproach the 100-year-old Georgian-style mansion via a private drive, creating anticipation for the unforgettable moments that await.\n\nAscend the historic grand stairway to discover elegantly furnished getting-ready suites with private bathrooms for the wedding couple, adding a touch of grandeur to your day.\n\nThroughout the seasons, Floriana provides a captivating backdrop for your event.\n\nExchange vows on our sprawling lawn, followed by a garden cocktail hour and reception under our Sail-cloth tent, or opt for a cozy winter wedding in the mansion's ballroom. The ballroom features gleaming hardwood floors, crystal chandeliers, fireplaces, and French doors opening to meticulously sculpted grounds—an elegant blend of history and natural beauty.\n\nOur commitment to providing a memorable experience remains unwavering, and we are excited to embark on this new chapter with you. Floriana is more than just a name; it represents a celebration of history, love, and the promise of beautiful beginnings.",

    "description": "From May to late October, an elegant white peaked tent with chandeliers and bistro lighting is erected alongside the wedding grass in the tranquil setting of the estate grounds, with an accompanying cobblestone patio. For intimate weddings in late Fall, Winter, and Spring, you will have exclusive use of the mansion's first floor and two gorgeous suites. Weather allowing, a garden ceremony may be possible.\n\nThe mansion's first floor is an ideal location for social gatherings throughout the year. Rich wood paneling, excellent imported marble fireplaces, and magnificent architectural elements adorn the interior rooms, adding elegance to every occasion. The estate's gardens are connected to the inside rooms, inviting guests to stroll outside and take in the breathtaking scenery.\n\nFor your next conference of 5 to 100 people, reserve one or more of the Stevens Estate's formal rooms, or the seasonal tent for up to 250 people. There are a variety of meeting room configurations available, as well as several breakout and refreshment areas. Refreshment Spaces and Aces\n\nThe Moses Stevens Estate at Osgood Hill in North Andover is one of the greatest intact examples of Aesthetic Design in North America, with over one hundred acres of magnificent New England surroundings. The National Register of Historic Places currently includes the 143-acre estate and its buildings. The mansion's exquisite interiors capture the drama of each day in ever-changing conditions of sunlight and shade, with a slogan of \"art for the sake of art, beauty for the sake of beauty.\" The best backdrop for any event is lush landscaping, gardens, and forest walks. Each of the estate's red-brick and riverstone structures is distinct and intriguing, embracing their natural environment as they did over a century ago.\n\nThe Stevens Estate at Osgood Hill is one of the best preserved examples of the late-nineteenth-century Aesthetic Design Movement. Its tranquil, natural location inspires and enriches visitors, much as it did the carpenters and masons whose work continues to surprise visitors today. The Town of North Andover now owns the Stevens Estate at Osgood Hill, which is maintained by Fireside Catering. A part of the proceeds from our events is re-invested in the estate to help restore and maintain the mansion, estate buildings, and grounds. Five bathrooms have just been restored to their former glory, with magnificent rich colors, antique fixtures, and many original features. By booking The Stevens Estate for your wedding, social event, or meeting, you are assisting in the preservation of this magnificent estate for future generations.",

The 2,100-acre Crane Estate is an unforgettable destination for your special event with its winding salt marshes, miles of barrier beach, and beautiful hilltop mansion. Chicago industrialist Richard T. Crane, Jr. first purchased the land that would become The Crane Estate in 1910. Crane was captivated by the beautiful landscape, and over the next two decades worked with some of America's leading architects and landscape architects to shape his summer retreat, sited with hilltop vistas of the Atlantic in an area of the property known as Castle Hill. In 1928, Castle Hill was crowned with a 59-room Stuart-style mansion designed by world-renowned architect David Adler. Today, the Crane family mansion is known as The Great House on The Crane Estate and is protected, along with the rest of Castle Hill, as a 165-acre National Historic Landmark.",

    "description": "In 1997, when the Duxbury Bay Management Society was established, the 2.5-acre parcel was the only remaining waterfront property in Duxbury that allowed for easy access to the Bay. The DBMS campus was acquired and named in honor of William P. Ellison as a result of the generosity of the Ellison Foundation and many others.\n\nWhen the DBMS replaced its aging and dilapidated bulkheads and built a new boat basin and launching ramp along the southern edge of the campus in 2000, the campus was transformed. The school also acquired the properties on either side of the access road from Washington Street, which were previously owned by the school. When two old structures were demolished in July 2003, a new residential building was completed, and a state-of-the-art storm water management system was built, the campus was significantly improved.\n\nIn 2006, DBMS launched a $5 million fundraising campaign to complete the school's master plan, which included the construction of safe and adequate facilities. After a lengthy fundraising campaign, construction was completed in time for the summer 2009 classes to begin on time. We were able to realize our vision of a modern, energy-efficient building that would house accessible classrooms, an erg room, Clifford Hall, administrative and commercial offices, locker room facilities, and a large garage thanks to the efforts of many volunteers, staff, and Board members.\nThe Duxbury Bay Maritime School is tucked away in the heart of historic Duxbury and its charming bayside setting, making it one of the most popular venues on the South Shore. For private social events such as wedding receptions, showers, holiday parties, and family reunions, we provide the ideal setting. Please contact us for more information. The campus is located on the shores of Duxbury Bay, Massachusetts. The Smith Building at Duxbury Bay Maritime School (DBMS) offers breathtaking views of Duxbury Bay and the surrounding area for all visitors to enjoy.\n\nClifford Hall has an indoor space of 2400 square feet and an outdoor space of 600 square feet on the deck. The DBMS is fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Our front porch and paver area, both of which overlook the water, are also available for use – making them ideal for cocktail hour and/or a waterfront wedding ceremony on-site.",

LaBelle Winery in Derry had our exact date available and the venue exceeded our expectations. I'm so glad things ended up working the way it did, it really was meant to be! Kim, the Director of Sales, was so easy and awesome to work with, and our day-of team went above and beyond. Everyone complimented the amazing food and the beautiful venue. We also had our rehearsal dinner at Americus the night before and the food was incredible. Thank you LaBelle Winery - Derry - we had the most amazing experience!"

    "description": "The Meadow is a place where people go to relax and unwind after a long day of work.\nDifferences between the two epochs\nA family-owned and operated cattle farm for more than 40 years, Red Ridge Farm has been producing quality beef. We have more than 50 acres of pasture that is lovely, peaceful, and natural. This land has been cultivated, cared for, and cherished by two generations of my family members. It's quiet, tranquil, and far away from the hectic, chaotic lives that we all lead today.\n\nOur daughter came to us in the winter of 2011 and said, \"I want my wedding here, at home, in the cow field.\" This was the beginning of a long journey. We thought she was insane at first, but then we realized that it was the ideal location for her, our nature-loving daughter, and for all of the couples who want to celebrate one of the most significant days of their lives in the midst of all that nature has to offer on their special day. So, on one of the rainiest days of June 2012, she and her love were united in marriage in what turned out to be the most beautiful and memorable wedding any of us had ever witnessed.\n\nWith character, charm, and beauty...and cows...we provide a one-of-a-kind rustic country setting. It's a field brimming with love from the couples who have made the commitment of a lifetime to one other here in the midst of nature, and from the guy, the farmer, who has tended to and loved the land for the better part of his life. This is where love lives, according to the family and children who live and play here, as well as the animals who roam freely and calmly throughout the day. We would be happy to share this place with you on your special day.\n\n\n\nAs a result, we are conveniently placed in the seaside town of Salisbury, Massachusetts, just minutes from major highways 95 and US-1 and a few miles south of the New Hampshire border.",

We had 168 guests, and rented a tent because we were unsure of what event restrictions would be. In the end we did not need it, but I am so glad we had it! It rained at the beginning of cocktail hour, after it was set up outside, but it gave guests a chance to explore the inside of the mansion or have appetizers in the small tent attached to the carriage house. The rain quickly cleared and guests were able to roam the gardens outside. Having a tent made for a large dance floor, with no dinner tables in the carriage house. We were married at St. Mary's church which is conveniently only 2 blocks away from Linden Place! All of our guests were talking about what a unique and beautiful venue Linden Place was! Everyone working at Linden Place was welcoming and excited for our wedding day, and could not have been easier to work with. I highly recommend Linden Place as your wedding venue!"

Linden Place has everything: beautiful gardens outside for the ceremony; the classic, historic mansion; and a big, rustic, barn-like room for the reception. There's a wide range of scenery, both for your guests to enjoy, and for you to take pictures in. I worked with Susan leading up to my wedding there, and she was amazingly helpful; she was professional, responsive, and went above and beyond making sure everything was just as we wanted it for our wedding. Additionally, we loved Linden Place because of the location: it's right on beautiful/historic Hope Street in Bristol and close by to the water. We had a lot of out-of-town guests, and this is such a lovely location for them to experience their first time in Rhode Island at. Overall, I would highly recommend Linden Place to anyone considering a wedding there!!!"

The grounds are beautiful, and the entire day ran so smoothly. Our guests appreciated the ease of having the ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception in one location. They also enjoyed roaming around the museum and garden. As the bride, I could not have asked for more. From the B&B next door, to the bridal suite upstairs, to the decorated carriage house, I was over the moon. Thank you again!"

We feel lucky to have stumbled upon Linden Place while walking around that afternoon. We were immediately drawn to the venue and booked it far in advance because we knew it was the one. It has a beauty and grandness that you can't explain unless you see it for yourself. The grounds and mansion are well kept and the gardens looked beautiful for our June wedding. We were so fortunate to have the most amazing weather the day of and utilized all of the indoor/outdoor spaces. The carriage house can be transformed into whatever your reception vision might be. It has grand ceilings, rustic beams, gold brick walls and a beautiful fire place that becomes an interesting focal point especially when you dress up the mantle with floral arrangements and candles etc. If you are looking for an intimate, romantic venue in a great location then this is the place for you!"

My husband was sold as soon as we stepped foot onto the property! The reception room looks very simple at first sight but it really leaves it open to doing whatever you would like with the room. My wedding on October 11th, 2019 was absolutely perfect in every single way. Kelly was so helpful throughout the whole entire wedding planning process. She was responsive and answered all questions we had. Unfortunately the weather on our wedding day was not ideal and Kelly reached out to us a couple days before with options regarding our cocktail hour since it was supposed to be outside. She was on top of everything! The staff on the day of was super helpful! Their attention to detail did not go unnoticed! They were very laid back regarding us girls getting to the venue early to finish getting ready. The whole wedding planning process went so smoothly working with Kelly and Linden Place!

        "description": "Wow! We can’t begin to describe how perfect Linden Place was for our August 17th wedding. We visited Linden Place in January 2019 and met with Kelly who we instantly felt comfortable with and that did not change throughout the entire process. We loved how unique the venue was and all the old character it maintained, while still allowing us to add our own modern touches in their gorgeous (and air conditioned) ballroom. Our guests were blown away with how beautiful and charming the venue was - from the ceremony and cocktail hour in the gardens, to our reception in the ballroom, it was like a fairytale. We could not be any happier we chose Linden Place and highly recommend it to anyone looking for the perfect Rhode Island wedding, without the “stuffiness” and high price tag of most Newport mansions. Not to mention Bristol becomes your own little town for the weekend. Everything from rehearsal dinner, to hotel, to after party was within walking distance of the venue, making it a breeze for ourselves and all of our guests."

        "description": "Linden Place and the Town of Bristol is a rare gem! We stumbled upon the venue as a recommendation from our caterer when we unexpectedly had to change venues. The saying holds true \"everything happens for a reason\" and we truly feel it was fate and we were meant to end up in Bristol, RI. From our initial tour to day-of at our wedding, Linden Place's staff was absolutely wonderful to work with. Kelly went above and beyond to make sure the wedding and lead up went smoothly. She was such a joy to work with. We were married mid-June and it was a beautiful day. The grounds were stunning with the gardens in full bloom. We had our ceremony and cocktail hour in the gardens and then the reception in the carriage house. We did bring in a decor company to bring more of an elegant feel to the ballroom and that was just the icing on the cake. The day was magical and we couldn't have been happier with our choice!"

        "description": "Linden Place was beautiful, and we had a magical day--however, they did not seem very wedding friendly. Leading up to the wedding, they were helpful. The representatives they had the day of the wedding, however, were quite rude and unhelpful when dealing with our guests and the bride/groom. At one point when my mother was trying to bustle my dress, one of the representatives told me that it was horrible and it would ruin the wedding if I walked into the reception looking like that. If anything, we felt like a nuisance to them. hat is the last thing a bride and groom should feel on their day, which is why I only gave them four stars."

    "description": "During your stay at the Lord Thompson Manor, we will provide you and your guests with a private environment in which you can use the Manor and Cottage House for your Rehearsal Dinner, Late Night Gathering, Spa Treatment, Wedding Reception, After Party, and Farewell Breakfast over the weekend.\nIn order to make each of these Wedding weekend events truly extraordinary, we believe that four key elements must be present: food, staff, on-site planning and coordination, and romance.\nWhen it comes to a wedding reception at the Lord Thompson Manor, the flow is designed to create a party atmosphere rather than a traditional \"sit-down\" reception style. Starting with a Champagne toast, which is typically held on our Side Garden Balcony following your ceremony, your reception will get underway! Following the toast, cocktails and passed hors d'oeuvres are served throughout the Manor, encouraging your guests to mingle and explore the grounds of the estate. Your guests will be seated in the Dining Rooms for a dinner that will include our Chef's Duo Entree Plate. After only about an hour, we begin the first dance, Cake Cutting, or any other formalities you wish to include, in order to get your guests up and out of their dining tables and into the Conservatory for the reception. For the remainder of the Reception, the Music takes it away from you. Cake, coffee, and dessert are served at Stations, eliminating the need for your guests to return to their formal tables after the meal is finished. Your guests will be active participants throughout the evening rather than passive observers at their tables, which is exactly how we like our parties.",

With 23-foot ceilings and clerestory windows for plenty of natural light, our 5,500-square-foot venue also features a 50-seat island bar topped with imported Italian Carrara marble, A/V capability on our large scale flat screen display and an outdoor patio area, coat check, and private parking.

    "description": "In addition to being a National Historic Landmark, the Lyman Estate, also known as \"the Vale,\" is considered to be one of the finest examples of a country estate built in the style of eighteenth-century English naturalistic design in the United States. For his family's residence in 1793, shipping merchant Theodore Lyman commissioned renowned architect Samuel McIntire to design and construct a Federal-style residence.\nThe house was first expanded in the Victorian style in 1882, and then remodeled in the Colonial Revival style in 1917, under the direction of the family. The thirty-seven-acre property includes gardens that have been meticulously preserved as well as historic greenhouses. During a tour of the mansion, which is now a wedding and corporate event venue, you can learn about the history of the Lyman family. One of the building's architectural features is a graceful oval parlor and an elegant ballroom, both of which can be seen in the upcoming film adaptation of Little Women. Pay a visit to the Lyman Estate Greenhouses for stunning plants and knowledgeable advice.\nHistoric New England is adhering to all applicable state, local, and CDC safety regulations for the Waltham location. All employees and visitors are required to wear protective masks. Improved cleaning and disinfection procedures have been implemented. The number of people who can join the tour is limited.",

    "description": "At the Charles River Museum of Industry and Innovation, you may create a unique and thrilling ambiance for your special occasion. Many of Greater Boston's most memorable special event experiences take place against the backdrop of our historic 19th-century textile mill, which overlooks the lovely Charles River. Weddings, birthday parties, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and other special public and corporate events are all common occurrences at our venue.\nAt no additional cost, the Museum can close to the public at 3:00pm on the day of an evening event. With (1) approval from the Museum and (2) a $150 per hour cost, earlier setup/load-in times are available. Ceremony rehearsals can be requested and are available at the Museum's discretion for a fee of $200 for up to 2 hours.\nWe also have a package for you if you're seeking a unique space to organize a lecture, conference, or meeting. Many of Greater Boston's most memorable special event experiences take place against the backdrop of our historic 19th-century textile mill, which overlooks the lovely Charles River. The \"Lowell Room\" in the Museum's Innovator Center can accommodate parties of 8 to 35 people. It comes with a ceiling-mounted projector, a retractable projection screen, and a sound system; all you need is an A/V source. For pre-event coffee or breakfast service, lunch breaks, or post-event cocktails, our Conference & Meeting packages include an additional one hour of museum viewing either before, during, or after your event — an entertaining and inspiring enhancement for pre-event coffee or breakfast service, lunch breaks, or post-event cocktails.",

    "description": "When you attend a private event at the Biltmore with your family, friends, or coworkers, you get to enjoy all of life's greatest hits in one wonderful evening! We can collaborate with you to design a menu based on the Biltmore's trademark appetizers, entrees, sides, and desserts.\n\nWithin the renowned walls of the Biltmore, there is something very distinctive and unique. As you travel the century-old wood floors to your private Biltmore party room, you are a part of history, from the original stamped tin ceilings to the beautiful wood paneling. You can almost imagine the big parties that have taken place throughout the decades to celebrate life, love of food, and good times. With these excellent places available for your perfect celebration, this local tradition continues today.\n\nThe Biltmore, which opened in 1914, has a long history as a Newton favorite. It started out selling breakfast and ale to local industrial workers staying the night, and its four-lane bowling alley was a popular hangout for decades. The Biltmore was a secret speakeasy for the upper crust during prohibition, frequently hosting private events for dignitaries, politicians, and celebrities.\n\nThe Biltmore underwent a stunning refurbishment a century after it first opened, restoring the ancient building's grandeur while providing a more pleasant atmosphere. Much of the original brick façade and interior have survived the test of time, as has the original wood flooring. We maintain the Biltmore's spirit alive today with American food and a rotating variety of local beers and handcrafted cocktails.\n\nSomething exciting is always happening at the Biltmore. Our events give a traditional restaurant experience a new spin. Come in for Oyster Mondays, Karaoke Fridays, and a whole lot more. We also have a private dining room available, which is ideal for any special occasion.\n\nWe are excited to share history with you!",

Our chef will create a menu tailored to each guest's specific needs, budget, and preferences. We don't have standard function menus that accommodate everyone.

Our private dining area and friendly hospitality will make your next occasion genuinely unforgettable, whether it's a family style dinner for 12 or a dinner party for 150.\n\nSicily and Toscana can be combined to seat up to 100 people for a sit-down meal and 170 people for a cocktail party.\n\nAll of our event venues are equipped with cutting-edge technology, including iPod connections, Blu-ray DVD players, and plasma TVs.\n\nIn Italy, a real Artisan mixes simplicity with time-honored scratch preparation using the finest ingredients.

    "description": "THE ROOM OF THE BLACKSMITH\nWe used to have a blacksmith shop in our private dining room, which was originally part of the working quarry. The forge, which was the hearth of the blacksmith, was where granite cutting tools were created, repaired, and sharpened. The Blacksmith Room is decorated with wrought-iron chandeliers, skylights, and vintage sconces that were imported from Europe. When set up as a king-style table, the room can comfortably accommodate 22 guests, or up to 30 people when set up as 5 tables of 6. The perfect setting for a rehearsal dinner, business presentation, family gathering, or cocktail party.\n\nTHE ROOM WITH THE STONES\nThere are large dark wood bamboo dividers separating this private function space from the main dining room, creating a spacious event space with stone-walled cathedral ceilings, wall mounted wine racks, and floor to ceiling windows. Tucked away toward the front of the building, The Stone Room is the ideal setting for your special occasion or reception. Can accommodate a 30-person event, complete with buffet and cake serving areas as well as gift-giving areas\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE QUARRY ROOM\nOur Main Dining Room, which overlooks our granite quarry and patio, provides breathtaking views through a wall of full-height glass windows. Along with cathedral ceilings, rustic exposed wood beams, skylights, and wrought-iron chandeliers, the Quarry Room has a warm and inviting atmosphere. Eight four-person leather booths, as well as flexible table arrangements, can accommodate a total of 55 people. This space, when combined with our Stone Room, can accommodate up to 95 guests.",

    "description": "As you enter The Hall, see the master stairwell, and listen to your heart, your journey begins. Ascend the stairwell to the Grand Ballroom, where you may admire the antique gilt mirrors and Italian chandelier, as well as the famed spring frame floor constructed by Samuel McIntire for effortless dancing. You know a Hamilton Hall wedding is for you, your loved ones, and friends the instant you see the Musicians' Gallery mirrored in the Russian mirrors and anticipate the toss of your bridal bouquet. For a memorable ceremony, combine romance and history.\nHamilton Hall is widely regarded as one of the most important Federal structures in America, having been built in 1805 on the newly laid-out Chestnut Street. It still serves as a meeting spot for Salem locals, visitors, and special visitors. The Hall was constructed during the height of Salem's wealth, and it is surrounded by beautiful houses of Salem ship captains and merchants who made fortunes importing exotic commodities from far-flung ports throughout the world. The Hall, designed and built by Salem's renowned architect and woodcarver Samuel McIntire, provides a rare opportunity to see his vision and skill in situ and in a public place.\nOngoing events can be as lighthearted as a dance lesson on the spring-based dance floor or as serious as a presentation on nuclear power during the Hall's annual World Affairs Lecture Series; the Hall has a long history of hosting internationally renowned opinion shapers for 75 years. Hamilton Hall events combine the elegance of the past with the vitality of the contemporary. Hamilton Hall is a gathering place for joyful occasions and historic moments, from the annual Americana Lecture to concerts by the Boston Artists Society and community members' nuptial ceremonies.",

Throughout the restaurant, we can host private and semi-private parties of 10 to boisterous gatherings of 225 guests.\n\nCoach Grill has been dedicated to providing outstanding, five-star service and fine meals suited to each guest's individual interests since the 1930s. Coach Grill is part of the long-standing Wayland neighborhood and rests on the original site of the Red Coach Grill, a popular local hangout until it was destroyed by fire in the late 1970s.\n\nThe Red Coach Grill was rebuilt decades later, and people returned as if reuniting with an old friend. This cherished New England institution, now known as Coach Grill as part of the Tavistock Restaurant Collection family of concepts, still serves the same elegant hospitality and exceptional cuisine as its ancestor, lighted by the warmth of its original stone hearth fireplace.\n\nIt has been our joy to politely serve the New England comforts both appreciated by locals and admired by visitors for decades and years to come, as we are rooted in the Massachusetts community.\n\n“Best west suburban steak house. No question. Excellent steaks, fresh oysters, lively bar with bartenders who by themselves are worth the trip. Nice people” -Michael D.\n\n“I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. Food is excellent, service is exceptional. You will love your experience here... we did! It was all so good. Highly recommended!” -Haneen Y.",

    "description": "In addition to sculptures in the landscape, deCordova's mission is to educate and delight visitors with contemporary art from New England and beyond. This is accomplished through both outdoor sculpture and museum exhibitions.\n\nThe deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum, which opened in 1950 and spans 30 acres west of Boston, is the largest park of its kind in New England. It was the first of its kind in the country. In 2009, deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum changed its name from deCordova Museum and Sculpture Park to deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum to emphasize its renewed focus on sculpture and to support the institution's goal of becoming a premier Sculpture Park. The name change was made to emphasize the institution's renewed focus on sculpture and to support the institution's goal of becoming a premier Sculpture Park. The Sculpture Park is home to more than 60 works of art, the majority of which are on loan to the Museum, and offers a constantly changing landscape of large-scale, outdoor, modern and contemporary sculpture and site-specific installations by artists from around the world. On the inside, the Museum offers a diverse selection of changing exhibitions as well as innovative interpretive programming.\n\nPatrons of the deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum can participate in a variety of activities throughout the year, including snowshoe tours, yoga in the park, nature tours, curator and artist conversations, and a variety of special talks, screenings, and events. Lincoln Nursery School is located on the grounds of the deCordova Museum of Contemporary Art, making it the first preschool in the United States to be integrated into a contemporary art museum.",

    "description": "A celebration at the Codman Estate Carriage House is a wonderful way to commemorate a wedding, corporate gathering, or other special occasion. The Codman Estate, nestled in an expansive landscape of gardens, lawns, and meadows, provides a unique country setting just twenty miles from downtown Boston while remaining close to the city.\nThe Codman Estate Carriage House has been completely renovated and is now available for private parties and other events. This venue, with its rich wood paneling and rustic ambiance, offers a casually elegant and reasonably priced option for your wedding reception. The Italian Garden is a particular highlight of the landscape. Featuring a marble-columned pergola covered in flowering vines, this surprisingly formal secret garden is an ideal location for wedding ceremonies and receptions. In the garden, guests can relax by a reflecting pool that is surrounded by flowers, classical urns, and statues. A beautiful but less formal setting for photographs can be found in an English country garden, which was originally designed and maintained by Dorothy Codman.\n\nYour rental includes the use of the Carriage House, gardens, and grounds, as well as the freedom to create your own event from the ground up. Tables should be decorated with fresh flowers and fine linens for a formal wedding. For a summer barbecue, use checkered tablecloths and a volleyball net to create a festive atmosphere. In the grand Meadow, you can entertain your guests with lawn games, cocktails, and passed hors d'oeuvres. Dance until the wee hours of the morning.\n\nIn addition to hosting corporate meetings and business events such as parties, client entertainment, wine tastings, and awards dinners, the Codman Estate also serves as a beautiful and relaxing setting for weddings. Having a clambake or barbecue on the lawn while playing games or listening to music is a popular warm-weather activity. Our experienced events staff will assist you in selecting a caterer and will be available to you throughout the entire planning process.",

    "description": "The Mansion at Glen Magna Farms has been described as \"as close to heaven as one can go in this earth,\" with an estate of eleven acres. Routes 1 and 95 are less than a mile away. The venue is great for weddings.\nFormal gardens massed with colorful perennials, annuals, shrubs, and an arboretum make up the award-winning landscape. The Old Fashioned Garden is anchored by a replica of Francis Peabody's original Gazebo from 1840.\nIf the ceremony takes place within the five-hour rental time range, there is no additional price for the ceremony on the premises. If the ceremony is held outside of the five-hour time frame, an overtime fee will be charged. The bridal party is welcome to attend two hours prior to the ceremony's start time to change and take photos. One hour of rehearsal time is included the day before the wedding.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Joseph Peabody, the wealthiest Salem shipping trader of the time, purchased a twenty-acre Danvers property with a dwelling described as \"perfectly prepared for a gentleman's seat\" in every respect. The property developed from a twenty-acre acquisition to over three hundred and thirty acres, serving as the family's summer hideaway for a century and forty-four years.\n\nThe house and gardens were substantially enlarged and enhanced by Ellen Peabody Endicott, Joseph Peabody's granddaughter, by 1892. In 1893, she commissioned Little, Browne and Moore of Boston to design the Mansion's enlargement to its characteristic colonial revival shape. Ellen Endicott received the Hunnewell Gold Medal from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in 1926, the year before she died. This award was granted to the owner of a three-acre estate that was tastefully and effectively planted with rare and desired ornamental trees and shrubs to offer successful instances of science, talent, and good judgment in the adornment of the country mansion.\n\nUntil his death in 1936, her son, William Crowninshield Endicott, Jr., continued to pour attention on the Farms, renovating and enhancing the estate. In 1901, he played a key role in bringing the Derby Summer House (built in 1794) to the site. Since 1968, the two-story Adamesque structure has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe Danvers Historical Society purchased the core eleven acres of the site in 1963 and has attempted to restore the gardens and grounds to their original appearance in the early twentieth century.",

The Connors Center offers several gorgeous sites for ideal weddings to become a reality, with its manicured flower beds, fieldstone walks, and stone terraces.\n\nSeveral prominent settings for indoor gatherings can be found within the Main House.

The Estate Room, which seats up to 150 people, has a lot of natural light and a floor-to-ceiling window that provides unrestricted views of the lush woodlands beyond.\n\nMany couples exchange vows in the calm but lush St. Cecilia's Garden, the Connors Center's plein-air, gorgeous centerpiece. The garden contains a natural stone staircase leading to a birch tree forest dotted with aromatic flower beds, which was originally created by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, landscape designers of New York's Central Park. St. Cecilia's Garden provides the ideal setting for your wedding ceremony, whether your style is vintage, rustic, or traditional. For up to 200 people, we provide traditional white folding chairs.\n\nBeautifully decorated private rooms are available at the Connors Center for wedding parties to relax and prepare for the main event.

    "description": "Danversport offers three elegant and flexible wedding event rooms, each with a breathtaking waterfront view for your special day. For visitors' enjoyment, each event venue has its own outdoor wedding ceremony or mingling area. We provide full catering services, a diverse menu, all-inclusive wedding packages, and wedding coordinators with years of experience working together with trusted local vendors to ensure that your big day runs well. Premium dinner packages, unique appetizers, featured cocktails, dessert stations, and late night munchies are just a few of the options available in our wedding packages to meet the needs of each couple. Choose from one of our three event spaces and take beautiful photos by the water that will last a lifetime.\n\nThe Harborview Ballroom and Sun Deck, the largest event area, can host weddings of up to 650 guests and offers beautiful waterfront views.\n\nThe Terrace Ballroom, which can accommodate up to 200 people, is an excellent choice for a traditional ballroom setting. When combined with the Waterfront Room, up to 300 people can be accommodated comfortably.\n\nLighthouse Point & Courtyard, a private dining room with a dance floor and a quiet courtyard, can accommodate small weddings of up to 90 guests.\n\nDanversport, which is owned and maintained by the DeLorenzo family, began as a dream more than 50 years ago when Joseph DeLorenzo envisioned a particular spot for the community to celebrate life's significant occasions. He and his wife Barbara eventually bought this lovely piece of property and began construction on a \"big band\" type dance hall and marina. The Danversport Yacht Club first opened its doors in 1970, and it rapidly became a popular spot for supper, dancing, and live music. Danversport has thrived and evolved throughout the years to accommodate weddings and special events of all sizes.\nWe're now in the third generation of the DeLorenzo family, and we're just as committed to giving exceptional experiences in a spectacular environment as Joseph was. We're also enthusiastic about the actions we're doing to better our business and assist our community by utilizing solar renewable energy, recycling, and vegetable gardening.\nAbove all, we're honored to continue assisting you in celebrating and making amazing memories. We hope you have a great day in Danversport! Thank you very much for your business.",

Saphire Estate offers a plethora of photo options to convey your love story, with stunning lakeside vistas, opulent fountains set amidst lush gardens and scenic woods. A comfortable fireplace, gold chandeliers, and a quartz bar top contrast with a range of rich textures and exquisite woodwork in a newly designed, separate cocktail space. Because your event is our exclusive emphasis, the entire estate, grounds, and fully modern amenities are exclusively yours to enjoy on your big day.\n\nRoberta and Gerald Saphire bought Daub's Highland Manor on Lake Massapoag in 1977 and changed the name to Saphire Manor and Inn. The Manor was created to accommodate the vacationers, visitors, and celebrities who flocked to the area during the summer season. It was originally known as Wentworth's and subsequently Anapolsky's. The famous Leonard Bernstein is said to have performed at the Manor's vast ballroom in the 1930s.\n\nJonathan Saphire and his wife Amie bought the property in 2006 and renamed it Saphire Estate, spending over a million dollars to renovate the house and gardens while maintaining their historic charm. With lakefront property, beautifully planted gardens, and a classically furnished ballroom, Saphire Estate became known across the South Shore as a perfect New England destination, hosting only one wedding at a time.\n\nSaphire Event Group is known for its meticulous attention to detail, attentive employees, and immaculate venues. Our highly educated staff has one goal in mind: to create the most beautiful backdrop for the most important occasion of your life. We'll take care of the details so you can focus on making memories!",

    "description": "The Stevens-Coolidge House is available as a photography site. It’s the perfect place for photoshoots for family, friends, a bridal party, an anniversary, and more.\n\nThe Trustees are the owners and managers of the land. This member-supported nonprofit conservation group works to safeguard rare places across Massachusetts and protects properties of extraordinary aesthetic, historic, and ecological importance for public use and pleasure. The Stevens-Coolidge Place is accessible for professional outdoor photography/portraits on a commission or in-kind basis.\n\nEnter the world of a former farm that became an early-20th-century estate, where an elegant and polished mansion is complemented by a newly expanded array of abundant gardens and flora. From 1914 to 1962, Helen Stevens Coolidge and her husband, John Gardner Coolidge—a diplomat descended from Thomas Jefferson and a nephew of Isabella Stewart Gardner—had their vacation home at Stevens-Coolidge House & Gardens.\n\nThe Stevens-Coolidge House & Gardens are situated on land that was once used for hunting and fishing by the Pennacook, Pawtucket, Massa-adchu-es-et, and Pentucket peoples. John and Elizabeth Stevens, who emigrated from England in the 1640s, were among North Andover's early European residents. Their grandchildren bought the land in 1729 and began farming it, naming it Ashdale Farm after the huge number of white ask trees that originally thrived on the property. For six generations, the Stevens family has cultivated this land. When Helen Stevens Coolidge inherited Ashdale Farm in 1914, it had become more of a family getaway than a money-making enterprise. Helen and her husband, John Gardner Coolidge, a US diplomat, made the property their holiday home. The home and gardens were renovated by noted preservation architect Joseph Everett Chandler, and the Coolidges converted the property into an extraordinary example of a neo-Georgian Colonial Revival mansion over the period of over five decades.",

    "description": "Private events held at Smolak Farms will be remembered for its serenity and tranquillity, which will make your next event extremely memorable. Our Pine Grove, which is adjacent to the Antique Apple Orchard, is the venue for our events.\n\nYour event might be huge or little, a birthday party or corporate gathering. Our objective is to make your event an experience that you and your guests will remember for a long time. Quality, consistency, and value are the cornerstones of our reputation, which we are committed to maintaining. All events are tailored to meet your specific requirements.\n\nSend an email to events@smolakfarms.com if you want to plan the perfect event. Please specify the date of your event as well as an estimate of the number of guests so that we can get started!\nSmolak Farms will host weddings in 2021.\nEven when life begins to return to more of the routine that we anticipate, Smolak Farms is still here to help our brides and grooms arrange safe and enjoyable festivities for their special days! We continue to comply to state laws and mandates, but we have successfully hosted events of all sizes in recent months, and we want to continue to do so throughout the rest of the year. Please contact Ashley Piazza, our Director of Events, if you have any questions or would like more information!\n\nSmolak Farms Information\nSmolak Farms has a long and illustrious history. Michael Smolak, the farm's owner, was present during his Aunt Willie's wedding on the farm when he was two years old. He had no idea at the time, back in 1954, that his wedding would mark the beginning of a long and lovely history of couples choosing Smolak Farms as their wedding location of choice.\n\nThe farm has roots that date back as far as 4500 years, to the time when Native Americans originally settled on the property. The lovely rolling hills of orchards and farmland that cover 125 acres serve as the perfect setting for this extremely important bonding experience between two individuals. Being linked to nature and all of the beauty it has to offer is a great way to begin a union that brings together not only two people, but two families and two lives as a whole.\n\nThe pine forest was a favorite picnic spot for Farmer Smolak and his family when they were children, and it has since become a destination for friends and relatives from all over the world. What stories those 100-year-old pines could tell about the many families who have enjoyed their shade and the countless couples who have exchanged holy vows beneath their canopy, if only they could communicate. Their sheer size and presence causes one to take a moment to reflect.",

    "description": "In addition to an 18-hole championship golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr., Charter Oak Country Club offers three tennis courts, an Olympic-size swimming pool, an adult Jacuzzi and a baby pool, workout fitness facilities, a Grand Ballroom for banquets and functions, as well as casual and formal dining options. Members of Charter Oak enjoy the feeling of belonging to a small, private community; the majority of members are your neighbors or your children's classmates.\n\nThe Clubhouse at Charter Oak is a 38,000 sq. ft. masterpiece designed in the traditional Georgian style and built in the early 1900s. As you approach the property from the main drive, the splendor of its presentation is breathtaking.\n\nWith its chandeliers, French doors, and floor-to-ceiling windows, the Grand Ballroom lends a charming, yet comfortable, atmosphere to all events. Our room rental fees range between $1,000 and $3,000, depending on the type of function and the date of the event. An overtime extension of no more than one hour is available at a rate of $275 per half hour and must be requested in advance. Overtime extensions of more than one hour are not available. One rehearsal is included in the $1,500 fee for our onsite outdoor ceremony. The fee also includes setup, additional folding chairs, and one ceremony. In the event that the ceremony must be moved indoors due to inclement weather, the ceremony will be held in the Grand Ballroom. All activities must be completed by 12:30 a.m. All food and beverages are subject to a 20 percent Club Fee on top of the regular price. The subtotal for food and beverages, as well as the rental fees, are subject to Hudson, Massachusetts Meals & Sales Tax. Charter Oak retains the right to request the use of a Hudson Police Detail for specific functions at its discretion. If it is determined that additional fees are necessary, they will be discussed prior to booking. Charter Oak, in contrast to many other hospitality businesses, is a NO-TIPPING facility. The Club pays all of its employees a generous hourly wage, and our employees are aware that they should not expect any tips or gratuities from Club members, guests, or people who are hosting events at the Club. All food and beverage orders at the Club are subject to a 5% service charge. This Club Charge is not intended to be a gratuity or a tip, and it is not considered such. No portion of the Club Charge is paid directly to any of the club's employees, whether they are regular employees or temporary employees hired for special events. Members, guests, and anyone else who comes into contact with the Club is strongly discouraged from making any additional payments beyond the Club Charge.\n\nThe Living Room, which is located adjacent to our Grand Ballroom, is the ideal setting for small gatherings, cocktail receptions, showers, and meetings for 25-70 people. It is also available for rental. It is equipped with a fully stocked bar and access to a private balcony with views of our lush golf course, which is ideal during the warmer months. With its oversized fireplace and warm lighting, this space can also be used to create a romantic atmosphere during the cooler months, making it ideal for any occasion or gathering.",

    "description": "Nestled along the banks of the Nunckatessett River in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts, the Nunckatessett Canoe Club was originally built in 1904 as a storage facility for 63 canoes. It offered members a place to keep their canoes while enjoying the scenic beauty of the river and the camaraderie of fellow enthusiasts.\n\nIn 1915, the club relocated and expanded, adding a second story to accommodate more canoes and a spacious assembly hall for dancing. Unfortunately, just two years later, the new building was destroyed by a fire.\n\nDespite this setback, the Nunckatessett Canoe Club became a popular venue for large social gatherings and dances over the following decades. It hosted legendary performers like Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Frank Sinatra, and Rosemary Clooney, making it a cherished spot for music and celebration.",

Concerts, family shows, conferences, conventions, trade exhibitions, corporate seminars, and much more can all be held here. Blackall, Clapp & Whittemore, an architectural firm, designed the 2,800-seat facility in 1922. Looking for the ideal place for your 'I DO' day that is a perfect blend of classic and comfortable? The Lowell Memorial Auditorium is a historic theatre in downtown Lowell, Massachusetts, with the ambiance to properly complement your special day's vision!\n\nThe Lowell Memorial Auditorium is an indoor venue on Merrimack Street in downtown Lowell, Massachusetts. Concerts, family shows, conferences, conventions, trade exhibitions, corporate seminars, and much more can all be held here. Blackall, Clapp & Whittemore, an architectural firm, designed the 2,800-seat facility in 1922. The Lowell Memorial Auditorium is administered by Lowell Management Group and is located in scenic and historic downtown Lowell.\n\nMill City Operation, which is owned and run by Tom McKay, Terry McCarthy, and Leo Creegan, took over management of the Lowell Memorial Auditorium in 1995. The Lowell Memorial Auditorium continues to thrive as a destination for all types of attractions under MCM's guidance, and is now busier than ever. The Lowell Memorial Auditorium has hosted events about 250 days a year in previous years.\n\nWalking through the structure is like reliving Lowell's and America's military history. All of the major combat sites from the American Revolution, including Bunker Hill and Trenton, Gettysburg and Appomattox, San Juan Hill, Bellows Wood, and Chateau-Thiery, are well-known. Many more fought, bled, and died in lesser-known engagements, which are also commemorated in the entablature. Fair Oaks, Cold Harbor, Spottsylvania, Chapultec, Soissons, and other cities have been named after them. To those who fought or died in them, all conflicts are as important.\n\nThe Auditorium now sits at the gateway to Historic Downtown Lowell, a beautiful and suitable monument to welcome visitors and possibly Belvidere's most proud structure.",

A trip was organized on Labor Day in the first year of operation, and the tradition of outings at Lake Pearl had begun.",

    "description": "Willow Spring Vineyards places a premium on community and quality. As a young family winery, our dedication to the people, vines, and environment that make up the region we call home is strong. We invite everyone to come by and participate in this event. We'll most likely be tending the vines or harvesting the grapes alongside family and friends if we take a stroll around the vineyards. So come try our wine and become a part of the Willow Spring Vineyards legend.\n\nAt Willow Spring Vineyards, we can make your fantasy come true, whether it's an exquisite setting, rustic charm, or a green facility. This hidden gem, only 30 miles north of Boston, is the ideal venue for your big day. Willow Spring Vineyards is a picture-perfect location for unforgettable events in our hand-hewn post and beam barn, which sits on more than twenty acres of land.\n\nThe barn can accommodate up to 99 people for events. A large landscape project completed in 2015 resulted in a lovely lawn area and patio with a stunning fireplace. This grass is large enough to accommodate a tent for up to 200 people.\n\nIn the year 2000, Jim and Cindy Parker bought a dilapidated barn and a plot of land from Mary Ray. We started the adventure with a strong focus on restoration and agriculture. Beginning with the dismantling of the eighteenth-century building, we began mapping and marking each piece in preparation for potential re-assembly. The edifice was pulled down piece by piece and logged for rebuilding with the help of family, friends, neighbors, and passers-by. For the huge space, an energy efficient system was designed as part of the green building planning. This barn is truly green, thanks to geothermal heating and cooling and a photovoltaic system (solar panels). Our two acres of grapes surround the beautiful 18th century barn, which can easily be seen from the road. The magnificent 25+ acres continue behind the barn, which may be appreciated from the wraparound deck or in front of the majestic hearth.",

    "description": "Treat yourself to genuine Italian hospitality during your next party or conference.\nOur expert hospitality team will handle all aspects of planning social gatherings, family gatherings, weddings, and business meetings. The Tuscan Kitchen does not host events. We're not the same in any way. Our sophisticated event halls are designed to provide an exclusive environment for entertaining your guests with excellent service and artisan cuisine in a beautiful, fashionable setting. Our chef will prepare a menu that is tailored to the needs, budget, and preferences of each visitor. We don't have standard function menus to suit everyone's needs. Using the same artisan cuisine that we serve in our restaurant, we create unique menus and an event program.\n\nThe Wine Cellar is Tuscan Kitchen's most private location. Consider hosting your next party or private dining event in a replica of a wine cellar in Tuscany's wine region. The chamber is made entirely of Tuscan limestone and includes wrought iron doors, a fireplace, a private bar and kitchen, and 4,000 bottles of Italian wine. Perfect for a cocktail party, dinner, and reception.\n\nUmbria is the ideal location for a romantic meal or lunchtime. With an optional AV Screen and Plasma TV, as well as connections for wireless microphone, iPod, and DVD, it's also great for a business conference.\n\nSicily is a lovely location for a small gathering over a stone hearth. It has a Wine Cellar style and feel, making it ideal for a small dinner group.\n\nA wonderful location for a cocktail hour before dinner, connected to our Outdoor Patio with fireplace and Plasma TV.\n\nJoin us at Tuscan Kitchen for your next event to enjoy delicious food and wine, lovely spaces, and welcoming staff.",

    "description": "Steve Violette of Dick's Market in Lunenburg, Massachusetts, farms over 40 acres of beautiful farmland at Apple Hill Farm & Country Club, which is part of the Apple Hill Farm & Country Club complex. In addition to the over 360 peach trees, there are also other fruit trees such as nectarines, cherries, apricots, and plums, as well as a diverse assortment of vegetables such as corn, tomatoes, peppers, assorted greens, cabbages, potatoes, beans, and many more! When the fields are in season, the restaurant and banquet facility takes great pride in serving their own produce, which is also available for purchase at Dick's Farm stand, which is located at 647 Northfield Road in Lunenburg, Massachusetts. We encourage visitors to take in the beauty of our farm while also learning more about the advantages of supporting local agriculture.\n\nWe invite you to visit us for dinner one evening in the Library Bar & Restaurant, or for a cocktail on the screened in porch on a summer's eve, or to celebrate your next milestone with us; whatever the occasion, we look forward to seeing you soon!\nApple Hill Farm & Country Club is a premier New England wedding venue located in the heart of the Berkshires. Due to our centralized location, which is only 48 miles from Boston and 23 miles from Worcester and only a few miles off of Route 2, we are easily accessible from points throughout Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and the rest of the Northeastern United States.\nWe are a family-owned and operated restaurant and event venue, so please bear with us as we introduce ourselves. In addition, we have a 35-acre farm on the premises, where we proudly serve all of our own produce during the harvest season. We only host one wedding per day, allowing our clients to select the time slot that works best for them. On site, we have a beautiful ceremony site overlooking our 350+ peach tree orchard that faces west, providing our couples with a stunning sunset view as their backdrop. A stone fireplace, full bar, and adjacent screened in porch are available for cocktail hour (depending on the time of day, the Library Bar & Restaurant area may also be available for cocktail hour), and our newly constructed ballroom, which can accommodate up to 200 guests, was completed in 2012. It is a formal and elegant space with stunning chandeliers, mahogany wood paneled accents, hand painted textured ivory walls, and a built-in dance floor. It is available for rental. Because of the outdoor ceremony site, the numerous photograph locations around the farm, and the formal ballroom reception, we are able to provide our guests with a timeless and elegant country wedding experience.\nEveryone is different, and we want your wedding day to reflect both your personalities and your style. From rustic chic to black tie, our venue provides you with the flexibility to create the wedding of your dreams!",

    "description": "Mila [mee:lah], short for Milagros, meaning “miracles” in Spanish, represents a love story—one of love for each other, family, and a deep passion for hospitality.\n\nMila’s owners, Jay and Liz Curcio, crossed paths over a decade ago through a client of The White Apron. Jay founded The White Apron in 2004, starting from his own kitchen. By 2011, the company had grown to cater weddings across the NH seacoast. Liz, an event planner and trained chef, was living in NYC and helping her best friend plan her wedding in NH, which just so happened to be catered by The White Apron.\n\nWhen Liz and Jay met, sparks flew, and they soon teamed up to grow The White Apron into a premier off-premise catering business, serving events across Maine, Northern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and the Lakes Region. Through ingenuity and the dedication of their talented staff, The White Apron not only weathered the pandemic but has continued to elevate its food and service as its clientele expands.\n\nWhile the off-premise business flourished, Jay and Liz shared the dream of opening a venue where they could create exceptional experiences for their clients year-round, without the constraints of an off-site kitchen. That dream is now a reality.\n\nThe venue is named \"MILA,\" short for Milagros, in honor of Liz’s grandmother. Mila was a forward-thinking, wise woman who, alongside Liz’s grandfather, ran a highly successful bakery for over 50 years. A tough, hardworking, and hospitable entrepreneur, Mila was deeply devoted to her family and community, passing down invaluable life lessons, traditions, and love.\n\nMILA by The White Apron honors her spirit, offering a welcoming space where guests feel seen and valued. At its core, the venue is built on a foundation of delicious food, impeccable service, and a classically elegant setting.",

Merrill's on the Waterfront is located in the heart of downtown Halifax. Ship Captain, Inventory Keeper, Developer, and Artist, Captain Edward Merrill was a major player in the whaling and fishing industries of New Bedford in the 1800s. He was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and raised there. You can learn more about him by reading the section below.\n\nMerrill's on the Waterfront, in addition to being a restaurant, also serves as an event venue, and can accommodate a wide range of events due to its unique waterfront location.",

    "description": "*Notice - Are you concerned that your wedding location may not be able to accommodate your guests in 2021? We are now accepting wedding reservations in accordance with the new MA Covid requirements, which includes open-air dining!\nWith open tented sides and large open air flow for events, our main ballroom has been renovated to create an elegant ambiance while still preserving an open airy sense. We will return to our regular room as soon as there are no problems with Covid! Because we are located a little further out in the country from Worcester, Boston, and Springfield, we are often classified as being in the low-covid zone classification system.\nWhile learning social distancing, your guests can enjoy our many outside spaces, which include exploring, playing yard games, and relaxing in our gardens. In addition, our dance floor and landscaping work provide enough of space for people to dance without isolating themselves! Check out the photographs on this page! *\nThis beautiful neo-classical three-story palace, which was completed in 1926, is the product of years of meticulous work. The steel-beam construction mansion, designed by Boston architects Blackhall, Clapp, and Whittemore, was built for Harding Allen, the proprietor of the Chas. G. Allen Co., a drilling and tapping machine firm and iron foundry. The company was established during the American Civil War to manufacture Yankee hay rakes. Approximately 742 individuals were employed by the company at its height of operations. The company has shrunk in size over the years, but it is still in operation.\nWhen Harding's wife, Carrie C. Allen, passed away in 1946, the estate was auctioned off, and Dr. and Mrs. Richard Fowler purchased a piece of the land, which included the mansion, for a sum of $1.25 million. Until it was repurchased by Steve Goldsmith, the great-nephew of Harding Allen, in 1972, the property remained in the possession of the Fowler family. After he and his wife Ina died in February 1995, the property was purchased by Alain Beret and James Fairbanks who lived there until the present day. Carmine and Grace Gugliotti, the current owners, purchased the property in February 2004 from the previous owners.\n\n\n\nThe mansion is highlighted by its imposing two-story portico as well as exquisite balustraded porches on three sides. The beautiful internal plaster molding, carved millwork, and marble detail, all executed by professional Italian craftsmen, has been preserved in its entirety on the interior walls. The use of original lighting fixtures is prevalent throughout the space.",

Whether you are here for an overnight business trip, a special wedding night, or a family holiday, our expert staff at the Publick House looks forward to meeting you and making your stay as pleasant as possible.\n\nThe most flattering compliment we receive is from repeat customers. Hearing from a guest that they appreciated our accommodations so much during their last visit that they'll be returning, or that they heard about us from someone they know and had to visit the Publick House to see for themselves, brings a smile to our faces. We've evolved into a family tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation, and we couldn't be happier about it.\nInn with a rich history\nSince its founding in 1771, the Publick House Historic Inn has maintained its 18th-century charm while still delivering 21st-century comforts to its guests. Each of our 17 guest rooms, which are located in this historical setting, is furnished with period antiques or reproductions.\nHouse of Chamberlain\nThis historic farmhouse, which was originally used for overnight accommodations, was renovated and expanded in 2016 to provide 20 guest rooms, including 12 suites. The farmhouse portion of the property was preserved and renovated, and the new construction added to the property in 2016. These rooms are intended for guests who are in the area on business or who are celebrating a wedding or other special occasion with friends and family over the weekend.\nCountry Inn & Suites\nLocated just a short walk from the Main Inn and situated amongst an apple orchard, the Country Motor Lodge opened its doors in 1960. The Country Motor Lodge, which overlooks the Publick House and is connected to the Inn by a private path and road, has 63 conventional hotel rooms and is open year-round. All of the hotel's guest rooms are non-smoking. On request, pet-friendly accommodations can be made available.",

    "description": "Over the years, many couples have recognized Chequessett as the ideal site for a traditional Cape Cod wedding ceremony and reception. This laid-back, coastal wedding venue is the ideal location for your next event or gathering. Whether you're planning a wedding, a commitment ceremony, a reception, a rehearsal dinner, an anniversary, or a private party, we're the place to be! Think of starting your event with a ceremony on our private beach, with the stunning background of Wellfleet Bay as a beautiful backdrop. There will then be a cocktail hour in the rustic Boathouse, where there will be a raw bar on the tented deck and beach games in the boat yard. Guests will enjoy views of the 9th fairway and sunset views of the bay from the tented clubhouse deck, which is just a few steps away from your dining room. The evening will conclude with dancing and cake in the Boathouse, possibly followed by a stroll along the moonlit beach. Chequessett is pleased to offer a diverse wine range that will accommodate any budget. When it comes to unique requests, our extensive network of contacts in the neighborhood becomes beneficial in offering assistance with everything from music, caterers, and flowers to the best seafood available in the area.\nWe have a variety of packages to choose from depending on your event requirements, and we are not an all-inclusive venue, making us the ideal place for your own Cape Cod wedding celebration.\nIndoor or outdoor, small or large, no matter your theme, the Chequessett Club could be the perfect backdrop for your special day.",

Patrons can enjoy upgraded mezzanine and balcony seating, remodeled VIP areas, multi leveled open room format as well as brand new restrooms and so much more. The Theatre will also soon be receiving a facelift on the front of the building with a new marquee installed in December of 2017.

    "description": "A beautiful space, the Dining Room at Molti On Moody in the Greater Boston area combines style and sophistication with world-class cuisine to create an unforgettable dining experience. Food and cooking are extremely important to us here at Molti On Moody, starting with our first-class charcuterie, which is produced locally in Waltham by our sister company New England Charcuterie. Everything, from our pastas to our pickled vegetables, is made entirely in-house, from start to finish. A peek into our kitchen reveals our wood-fired oven, which is used to prepare a large portion of our menu, which includes our incredible flatbreads, rotisserie chicken, and world-famous Moody's Meatballs, among other dishes. We have two main dining spaces, the Full Dining Room (which is a private space) and the Half Dining Room (which is a semi-private space), as well as the option to purchase the entire restaurant. Our events range in size and style from intimate evenings for two celebrating an anniversary and after-work cocktail parties to corporate luncheons and large engagement celebrations. Interested? Rebecca Symonds, our Catering & Events Manager, would be delighted to give you a tour of our facility and to collaborate with you to create a one-of-a-kind event experience.",

Baby showers, bridal showers, rehearsal dinners, wedding receptions, mercy meals, bereavement, birthday parties, family reunions, business celebrations, meetings, fund raisers, holiday parties, and much more are just a few of our specialties.\n\nWe have a versatile room that can accommodate anything from 20 to 120 people. Our excellent kitchen, as well as our attractively designed and versatile area, set Toscana's apart from other function venues. Having a full-service restaurant in addition to our event space allows us to cook from scratch every time, using only the finest ingredients. The proprietors' family of high-end restaurateurs from southern Italy acquired all of our menu items and cooking expertise. We host great chefs from Italy every year to uncover trendy new European ideas, always aiming to improve our clients' experience. A stunning private bar built entirely of natural stone with granite counter tops can be found in our event room. With no bartender or room fees, Toscana's will provide you and your guests with a fantastic experience at an unbeatable price that you won't find anyplace else on the North Shore.",

    "description": "We at Bournedale Function Facility provide the ideal lakeside setting for weddings and receptions in Plymouth and Cape Cod. Our wedding site is picturesque, thanks to its unique lakeside setting, and it offers a superb assortment of wedding facilities, inexpensive wedding costs, considerate consistent service, and distinctive one-of-a-kind wedding reception activities, among other things. Our main lodge, which is 6,000 square feet in size, has a large gourmet dining space that can accommodate up to 200 people for a wedding reception.\n\nOur 15-acre wedding location is located on a secluded Plymouth hideaway flanked by a deep, freshwater lake, making it one of the most beautiful venues in the area. A boat excursion will be a big hit with your visitors. Our wedding location allows guests to not only experience the tranquility and beauty of surrounding Cape Cod firsthand, but they may also participate in a variety of fun-filled activities on our waterfront, such as a post-reception bonfire on our beach! They may then stay the night at our facilities and enjoy a full breakfast, our indoor heated pool and spa, or a fantastic brunch the next day.",

    "description": "THE ART OF HISTORICAL TRADITION\nWhen you dine at Ellie's, you're treated as if you're a member of the family. This restaurant, inspired by dining traditions, strikes a harmonious balance between an art-filled, modern aesthetic and excellent food and genuine hospitality at every table. Keeping true to our namesake, Ellie Hall, an artist and mother who emanated elegance and warmth while enjoying lively conversation and friendly informality, our seasonal American cuisine is refined yet approachable, and our service is friendly and attentive. Every dish on the menu draws inspiration from her family's diverse heritage and traditions, resulting in a dish that is distinct in its taste and presentation.\nGET TO KNOW ELLIE HALL\nEllie, named after the mother of the company's founder, Craig Hall, was a self-assured trailblazer for women's rights as well as a compassionate teacher and artist who always sought out the beauty in life while maintaining a resolutely independent spirit. The gathering of friends and family to enjoy a delicious meal and spirited conversation was one of her greatest pleasures in life, and it was a communal endeavor that brought her immense joy. When Ellie's was established, it was done so in the spirit of community and goodwill toward all.\n\nThank you for joining the family.\n\nIN THE KITCHEN WITH THE ARTIST\nIn his previous position with ZaZa Hospitality, Dan Landsberg oversaw the culinary efforts at Dragonfly and later assisted in concepting and directing operations across the entire brand. He joins HALL Arts Hotel after an 11-year tenure with the company. Working with a variety of well-established restaurants, chefs, and brands, including Stephan Pyles Restaurant, Wynwood Hospitality, Tillman's Roadhouse, and the Lange Twins Family Winery and Vineyard, has been a highlight of his professional life. With great excitement, he has accepted his position as Executive Chef of Ellie's at the HALL Arts Hotel. He is looking forward to making his mark with a new menu of flavorful dishes made with seasonal and local ingredients.",

    "description": "The Bay Pointe Club, originally known as Wareham Country Club, was established in 1964 and operated until 1988. This was also the year that the Pavilion building was completed, as well as the year that the iconic 7th hole island green was built. At the present time, the Bay Pointe Club offers a unique collection of 18 championship golf holes designed by Geoffrey Cornish, a beautiful banquet facility, and a clubhouse that includes a well-stocked pro shop, a terrace serving area, and a covered, heated outdoor dining area located at the pavilion building. The course, which is rated 70.9 and slopes 122 from the back tees, is designed to be played at a par of 70 for men. The total yardage on the card (6201 from Blue Tees) appears to be quite small, but it turns out to be somewhat longer in practice. It is a par 72, 5,380 yard course that the ladies must contend with while playing from the red tees. The topography is mostly pleasant, with the exception of holes #1 and #2, which present a challenge to golfers who begin their round on the most hilly region of the grounds. The Bay Pointe Club does not use temporary greens under any circumstances. We have a sandy base soil that provides for excellent drainage for off-season golf, making us a perfect winter golf retreat destination.\n\nThe Bay Pointe Club is only a few minutes away from the picturesque old hamlet of Onset and the sandy sands of Onset Bay, making it an ideal location for a relaxing getaway. An attractive new landscape design softly surrounds our freshly remodeled banquet space, offering the ideal setting for an outstanding wedding reception.\n\nAll banquet and wedding meals are created by our in-house Executive Chef to meet the specific needs of our clients. The expert banquet crew at Bay Pointe will guarantee that your special day is remembered fondly and that everything runs smoothly from beginning to end. Our customized service and meticulous attention to detail are unrivaled in the industry!\n\nAll of our wedding meals may be tailored to meet the specific requirements and tastes of each couple. Wedding showers, rehearsal dinners, wedding ceremonies, and formal receptions can all be held in our rooms, which can accommodate groups ranging from 30 to 200 people.\nFill out our contact form to get in touch with us right away and to organize a tour!",

    "description": "Overbrook was originally built in the 1920s in the conventional two-story New England style. It is now a museum and community center. With its uncommon blend of grandeur and simplicity, it is welcoming to groups of all sizes, whether large or little. Each room receives plenty of natural light throughout the day. A clean, uncomplicated design is used to furnish the space, which is filled with antiques. A big kitchen, which many have referred to as \"the greatest kitchen I've ever worked in,\" complements the home's eight bedrooms, five bathrooms, living room with a massive fireplace, library, dining room that seats twenty, and a dining room that seats twenty. It is situated on a hilltop and is both roomy on the outside and inside. A 60-foot swimming pool and a big dancehall with wooden floors are located further down the stone route.\n\nBecause of its size, the mansion is ideal for gatherings such as family reunions, wedding celebrations, and corporate retreats. Many organizations have successfully integrated meetings, work, leisure, and recreation time to create a memorable team-building experience that has lasted for years.",

    "description": "You should consider Kalmar Village whether you are planning a vacation wedding on Cape Cod or if you reside in the area and are looking for a Cape Cod wedding location that allows you and your loved ones to gather for many days rather than just a few hours. Kalmar Village, with its six acres of coastal land and 400 feet of private beach, is the ideal location for a Cape Cod waterfront wedding. Moreover, with a variety of shingled-sided cottages scattered across the property, you and your friends and family can choose to settle down for a few days and enjoy spending quality time with one another.\n\nThe wedding décor at Kalmar may be anything you want it to be, unlike many other Cape Cod wedding venues that have a specific appearance that dictates the overall design of your reception (as long as it has panoramic views of the ocean!).\n\nChoose a ceremony on our beach complete with sand in your toes, and then set up your tent on our emerald-green lawn. Alternatively, would you want to have your entire event on the sand? Both are simple to accomplish at Kalmar Village. The place to bring your idea to life, whether it is a casual Cape Cod clambake for 300 guests or an exquisite sit-down dinner with white linens, is here.",
